            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Book of the <hi>Use</hi> of the <hi>Globe</hi> being commended by many able <hi>Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,</hi> for the best that is extant of this Nature; but being in the <hi>Latine</hi> Tongue, and therefore reserved only for Scholers; I was by some of them advised to get it Translated into <hi>English,</hi> and make it publike; not only to deep Wits, but to mean Capacities: Therefore (I hope) if the Translatour have used somwhat a more plain and familiar style in our Vulgar Tongue, then the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath done in that Elegant Language; that neither the Author will be offended at it, or the Buyer complain thereof.</p>
            <p>Some (but few) alterations I judged fitting to be made in this Translation; and that because there falls out some difference between our Authors own Globes, which he treats of, and the Globes that I have given forth this last yeer; of which Globes I indeed desire particularly to inform you; they being the latest done of any, and to the accomplishing of which, I have not only had the help of all, or most
<pb facs="tcp:199139:3"/> of the best of other <hi>Globes, Maps, Plats,</hi> and <hi>Sea-Draughts</hi> of New Discoveries, both of our Authors and other mens, that were then extant, for the Terrestrial Globe; but also the Advice and Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of divers learned and able Mathematicians, both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> for Tables and Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations both of Lines and Stars for the Celestial; upon which Globe I have placed every star that was observed by <hi>Tycho Brahe,</hi> one degree of lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude farther in the <hi>Ecliptick,</hi> then they are on any other Globes; so that whereas on other Globes the places of the stars were correspondent with their places in Heaven <hi>52.</hi> yeers ago when <hi>Tycho</hi> observed them; and therefore according to his rule, want about <hi>44.</hi> min. of their true places in Heaven at this time, I have set every star one degree far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the <hi>Ecliptick,</hi> and rectified them on the Globe according to the true place they will have in Heaven in the yeer <hi>1671.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Also on the Terrestrial Globes we begin not our Longitude at one and the same Place; Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor begins his at <hi>Pico</hi> in <hi>Teneriffa,</hi> an Island of the <hi>Canaries;</hi> but mine begins at the Isle <hi>Gratiosa,</hi> one of the Isles of <hi>Azores,</hi> which is <hi>10.</hi> deg. West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of <hi>Teneriffa;</hi> so that any place which shall have <hi>20.</hi> deg. of Longitude on my Globes, must be accounted to have but <hi>10.</hi> on our Authors; if <hi>30.</hi> but <hi>20.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Therefore to avoid trouble, I have in this Book
<pb facs="tcp:199139:3"/> named the Long. of Places as they are on my own Globes, <hi>viz.</hi> from the <hi>Azores;</hi> and was the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd thereto, because our other English Globes and Maps reckon their Longitude from them; yet (with <hi>Stevinus</hi>) I could wish that some particular place were universally pitcht upon by all <hi>Geographers;</hi> whether it were <hi>Pico,</hi> which he pleads for, or <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiosa,</hi> or other places, that others plead for; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed▪ to many that are but meerly skill'd in the <hi>Cosmographical</hi> part of Globes and Maps, this particular thing is matter of great Confusion; for <hi>Ptolomy</hi> began the Long. at the <hi>Fortunate Islands,</hi> (which M. <hi>Hues, p. 4. c. 1.</hi> in his Treatise of Globes, proves to be the Islands now called <hi>Cabo Verde,</hi> and not those now called the <hi>Canary Islands</hi>) because in his time they were the furthest Places of the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered World, towards the setting of the Sun. Others begun at <hi>Corvus</hi> and <hi>Flora,</hi> because under that Meridian the Compass hath no variation, but as most men affirm, respect duly the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South.</hi> Yet others say, it hath its just Position under the Meridian of S. <hi>Michaels,</hi> and therefore they begin their longitude there. Others again contradict that, and say it is between the Islands of <hi>Flores</hi> and <hi>Fayal</hi> that the Compass hath no variation; and therefore they begin their longitude there.</p>
            <p>In sum, We find that every one begins the longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude where it best liketh him; for the Spanjards of late travelling much into the <hi>West Indies,</hi> have
<pb facs="tcp:199139:4"/> placed their first Meridian or beginning of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude at <hi>Toledo,</hi> in those parts; and (contrary to all others) account it Westwards.</p>
            <p>Therefore seeing such diversity in all Nations, and as yet an Uniformity at home, I chose rather to concur with our own Countrymen, in a matter of so small moment, then follow the examples of some Strangers: Yet such as desire to see what <hi>Stevinus</hi> pleads for <hi>Pico</hi> in <hi>Teneriffa,</hi> may peruse our Latine Author, <hi>fol. 15.</hi> which in this Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation is purposely omitted; not in dis-rrspect either to our Author or <hi>Stevinus,</hi> but because I thought it impertinent to our purpose, in regard (as I said before) I desire chiefly to inform you of our English Globes, which have not their beginning of longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude at that place.</p>
            <p>One word more about the Longitude, and that is this. Although we have Tables shewing the Longitude and Latitude of many eminent Cities, Capes, Rivers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to which Tables most other Globes and Maps agree: yet do not all places upon my new Terrestrial Globe agree with those Tables: Therefore in a question of any gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven longitude, let it not puzzle you if you find not the longitude agree with your Tables; for the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror is in them, and not on the Globe: For later Observations, and newer Discoveries hath much rectified the Cosmographical Description of the Earth, both in Longitude and Latitude; for that
<pb facs="tcp:199139:4"/> on most Globes, Maps, and Tables, divers places (especially in the West-Indies) differ <hi>5, 6.</hi> yea <hi>7.</hi> degrees of longitude, both from my new Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial Globe, and from the Globe which our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor treats of, and also from a very large Map our Author hath lately given forth.</p>
            <p>Another thing I desire thee to take notice of, and that is this, Whereas in all questions that have a given time, our Author follows the New Style used in <hi>Holland,</hi> I have altered the date to the Old Style used in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The last (and scarce worth naming) is a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the Plain of the Horizon, which difference I having spoken of in the Chapter of the Horizon, I shall pass by in this place.</p>
            <p>I know not of any other alterations that are made from our Author, unless either in Printing or Translating, some small Errata's may have passed by; which if in this Edition thou takest pains to amend with thy Pen, and shalt acquaint me therewith, I shall be very thankful to thee, and careful to see it mended in the next.</p>
            <p>At the latter end of the Book I have annexed a small Collection out of D. <hi>Hood,</hi> which declares the reasons why such strange Figures and Forms are placed in Heaven; and withal, the Poetical Stories of every Constellation.</p>
            <p>I have not published the Use of the <hi>Copernican</hi> Sphere, which is the Second Part of this Book;
<pb facs="tcp:199139:5"/> because for the present I am unfurnished with En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved Plates, and other Appurtenances that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the making them; but so soon as I can have them perfected, which I hope will be very shortly, I shall then present thee with it: In the mean time, I desire thee to judge civilly of my <hi>first</hi> Undertakings; So shall I be obliged to gratifie thee with other things of this Nature, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to press forward, for the Honour of our English Nation.</p>

                  <p>The World being the Fabrique and Workmanship of the most omnipotent and infinite God is exhibited and held forth to our view by Astronomers, by two Globes of this kind, under a small, but proper shape; just as some stately Edifice may be represented by the Master-builder by some type or draught thereof: I say, under a proper shape; not only because the Globe resembles the Heaven and Earth in their roundness, but chiefly because in one of the Globes, the Firmament, with the fixed stars there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained, are lively represented to our view, in their true Scituation and Order, with the difference of their appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Magnitudes; and in the other, the Earth, with all its Territories, Regions, Islands, and Seas; all which, that they might more diligently and exquisitly (as it were) set forth and hold out to our view, they have with great industry, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented divers greater and lesser Circles, some without the Globes, and others upon the surface of the Globe it self; the greater Circles are such as have the same Center as the Sphere it self, and encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing the same about in the middle,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:199139:6"/> divide both it and themselves into two equal parts; the lesser Circles are such as have a different Center from that of the Sphere, and divide the same into two unequal parts. But because neither the difference of these Circles, nor their use either in the Celestial or Terrestrial Globe can be well understood without some fore-knowledge both of them and their use, we shall therefore describe them severally; and first, those that are common to both Globes, which are without the same, and not drawn on the Globe it self, and then those that are drawn on the surface of each Globe; and these according to their several proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in relation to each Globe distinctly.</p>

                  <p>EVery Globe is hung or fastned in a brazen Circle; whose two Poles be directly opposite to one another: and are placed in a straight line with the Eastern side of the Circle, the more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously to turn it about, without any sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible inclining either to the one or the other side of the Circle: and that side di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly answering to the <hi>Axis</hi> and the <hi>Poles,</hi> cuts the Globe in two equal parts. This Circle is called Meridian, from <hi>Medidian,</hi> which is as much as <hi>medius dies;</hi> or high noon because the Sun co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to this Circle, makes it Noon. It is divided into four Quadrants, and each of those into 90. deg. which on one side of the <hi>Axis</hi> are numbred from the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator</hi> to the <hi>Poles,</hi> by 10, 20, 30, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to 90. on the other side from the <hi>Poles;</hi> that the numbers of 90. meet in the middle between both <hi>Poles,</hi> to wit, in the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial line.</p>

                  <p>EVery Globe with its brass Meridian is placed in a wooden frame, bearing up a wide wooden Circle, with four Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters; whose supreme Superficies is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to divers uses.</p>
                  <p>And here I must crave leave to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress from the Author, because the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizons of those Globes he treateth of, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from the Horizons of the English Globes; and therefore I shall (for the benefit of our own Country men) insist particularly on them; it being no detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the worth of the Author, since only the manner, and not the matter is altered: For as himself upon the same occasion saith, <hi>If we respect the use, it matters not much.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, the outward Circle is divided into four equal parts, answering to the four
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:199139:8"/> corners of the World, <hi>East, West, North, South;</hi> and each of these is subdivided into eight equal parts, so that the whole circumference is divided into 32. equal parts, which Mariners call the 32. points of the Compass.</p>
                  <p>Next to the utmost Circle, are set down the ancient <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine</hi> names of the Winds, which (according to their account) were but twelve in number.</p>
                  <p>Then follows in a wide Row, twelve unequal divisions; in each division is the name of a Moneth in Capital letters; which Moneths are divided into so many days, as Astronomers have allotted to each particular Moneth, and marked with Arithmetical figures, 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forwards, to the Moneths end; before which figures stand the names of such Festival days, as are celebrated by the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> so that the twelve Moneths are divided into three hundred sixty and five days, which is the number of days accounted to a common yeer, and this Row is called <hi>The Kalender of the new Style:</hi> The first seven letters of the Alphabet are inserted for distinction of the week-days, because of the diversity of the Dominical letter.</p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:199139:8"/>
                  <p>Then succeeds the Kalender of the old Style used by us here in <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And last of all, a Circle, in which the twelve Signes are incompassed; each of which twelve Signes are divided into thirty equal parts, which are called <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;</hi> and each Degree into sixty Minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes; and each Minute into sixty Seconds; and each Second into sixty Thirds; and each Third into sixty Fourths; and so on infinitely if you please.</p>
                  <p>Now on the Horizons of those Globes that our Author treateth of, the Kalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and also the twelve Signes are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the utmost Circle of the wooden Horizon; next to them the Winds, and afterwards a Circle divided into three hundred and sixty Degrees.</p>
                  <p>In the inner edge of the wooden Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon are made two Notches, [just at the points or line of North and South; yet so, as that the East (or divided side of the Meridian) cut the Horizon exactly into two Semicircles,] into which two Notches the brazen Meridian is lett, and according to the direct extension of the North and South, descendeth even to that profundity, that one half of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:199139:9"/> is precisely extant above the Plain of the wooden Circle or Horizon; the other is depressed under it. The first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents to us the upper Hemisphere of the Heaven, conspicuous to out view, the other the lower Hemisphere, that is below us. That wooden Circle is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as it were a visible Terminator, in the likeness of the true Horizon, which distinguisheth the apparent Hemisphere from the latent. In the lower Basis there is a wooden Foot or Bed, with a notch in it, in which the Meridian resteth, that thereby the Meridian and Globe may be lifted up, and depressed, steadily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any tottering, to divers heights of the Pole, as occasion requires.</p>

                  <p>IN the Celestial Globe are described twelve Semi-circles, from one Pole of the <hi>Zodiack</hi> to the other, passing through the beginning of all the 12.

The second through the head of ♉ and ♏; and so of all the rest; divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the surface of the Globe into twelve equal parts, which are widest in the <hi>Ecliptick,</hi> and do lessen by little and little, as they approach toward the Poles of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> and at length wholly terminate therein. The entire <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies</hi> of any of these parts, derives its name from the Signe comprehended in the <hi>Ecliptick,</hi> between each Semi-circle: as for example: The <hi>Superficies</hi> lying between the two Semi-circles, drawn

                  </p>

                  <p>Three of these <hi>Zones</hi> the Ancients accounted inhabitable; one compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended between both the <hi>Tropicks;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Sun passing over the heads of those that lived there, sent forth its Beams perpendicularly upon the Earth, exciting (as they believed) intolerable heat; and for this reason they called it the <hi>Torrid Zone.</hi> The two other at the <hi>Boreal</hi> and <hi>Austral Pole,</hi> they named <hi>Frigid Zones,</hi> because it is there alwaies exceeding cold; the Sun only glancing upon the earth with its most oblique Beams; not darting it in such a recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude as to occasion any heat. The other two (as well that bounded by the <hi>Arc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Circle, and <hi>Tropick</hi> of <hi>Cancer,</hi> as
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:199139:18"/> that within the <hi>Antarctick</hi> Circle, and <hi>Tropick</hi> of <hi>Capricorn</hi>) they named <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Zones;</hi> and did account [them only] Habitable.

                  <p>Further, the Ancients distinguished the Inhabitants of the <hi>Zones,</hi> from the diversity of the shadows of Bodies; as into <hi>Periscii, Heteroscii,</hi> and <hi>Amphiscii.</hi>

                     </gap>; because the Meridian shadows in divers times of the year, do fall both into the North, and South; in regard the Sun goes from both sides of their Zenith: For the shadows when the Sun is in <hi>Boreal</hi> Signes, tend to the South; but when in <hi>Austral,</hi> to the North.</p>
                  <p>Because of the different scite of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site habitations, the Ancients have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Inhabitants of the Earth into <hi>Periaeci, Antaeci,</hi> and <hi>Antipodes.</hi> The <hi>Periaeci</hi> are those which dwell under the same Parallel, and Meridian, but in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Semi-circles of the Meridian. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taeci</hi> are those which live under the same Semi-meridian, but in several Parallels; one being <hi>Boreal,</hi> as much as the other is <hi>Austral.</hi> The <hi>Antipodes</hi> are those which dwell in opposite Parallels, and divers Semi-circles of the Meridian; that is, are opposed <hi>e Diametro,</hi> and have feet directly obverse to feet.</p>
                  <p>With the <hi>Periaeci</hi> we communicate in

               <p>THe Sphere of fixed stars (called the eighth in respect of the seven Planetary Orbes that it incompasseth)
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:199139:28"/> is turned by a double motion; the first called <hi>Diurnus,</hi> is made from the East, through the South, into the West, about the Axis of the world, and is finished in the space of 24. hours and taketh and carries about with it all the Planetary Spheres. <hi>Ptolomey</hi> is of opinion, that this is done by the motion of the ninth: some againe by the tenth; others the seventh; which used to be called the <hi>primum mobile:</hi> Although Artists con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur not in the number, yet in the mean time they agree, that the <hi>primum mobile</hi> is the cause of this motion, called <hi>Diurnus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other motion of the fixed stars called <hi>Secundus,</hi> and <hi>Planetarum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prius,</hi> is made into the contrary angle of the world, from the West into the East upon the Axis and Poles of the Ecliptick; and according to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Tycho Brache,</hi> it absolves its course in 25412. yeers: after which period of years, all the fixed stars return to the places in which they at first were posited.</p>
               <p>But because this proper motion of the fixed stars is made upon the Poles of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:199139:28"/> the Ecliptick, hence it will First easily be understood that they are not subject to any mutation of latitude, but only lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude; as making out in every hundred years 1. degree 25. minutes, or a whole degree in 70. yeers and 215. days.</p>
               <p>Secondly it discovers the difference of the signes of the Zodiaque, and <hi>Dode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catemories,</hi> or places of the Ecliptick; that is, why the images in the Celestial Globe, which constitute the Zodiaque, agree not with the <hi>Dodecatemories,</hi> (or their proper places) but <hi>Aries</hi> will go into the <hi>Dodecatemory,</hi> or place of <hi>Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus; Taurus</hi> into the place of <hi>Gemini,</hi> &amp;c. The cause of this, is this second and proper motion of the fixed stars; by reason of which, the stars and images change their seats and places, the <hi>Dode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catemories</hi> remaining without mutation of place; as may be made manifest by comparing the observations of diverse times: For about 2000. years ago, when the Aegyptian and Grecian Astronomers were intent upon the observation of the stars, the first star in the horns of <hi>Aries</hi> was about the beginning of ♈ (or the true Equinoctial Colure) from
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:199139:29"/> which it is now receded Eastward 28. degrees, so that as on the images (at that time agreeing with the <hi>Dodecate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories</hi> of the Ecliptick) they imposed also names on the signes of the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack from the neighbour Constellations.</p>

               <p>ALthough the Sun, and Moon and other Planets, with the eighth Sphere, are according to this Hypothesis carried about by the <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> out of the East into the West; yet every one (as the Sphere of fixed stars) hath a proper and particuliar motion to it self from the West into the East; And this the Sun absolves through the 12. signes of the Zodiaque▪ under the Ecliptick, in a Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical or Natural yeare (which is 365. days 5. hours and about 49. minutes;) and its dayly motion goes neer one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, from the tenth day of <hi>March,</hi> to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:199139:29"/> the 2. of <hi>June.</hi> Being Spring it passeth through <hi>Aries, Taurus,</hi> and <hi>Gemini,</hi> to the Summer Solstice; from the 2. of <hi>June,</hi> to the 2. of <hi>September</hi> being Summer, it runs through <hi>Cancer, Leo,</hi> and <hi>Virgo,</hi> to the Autumnal Equinox; From this time to the 2. of <hi>December,</hi> being Autumn, it passeth through <hi>Libra, Scorpio,</hi> and <hi>Sagittarius,</hi> till it come to the Hyemal Solstice; the other three <hi>Capricorn, Aquarius,</hi> and <hi>Pisces,</hi> it goes through in the Winter; from <hi>December</hi> the 2. to <hi>March</hi> the 10<seg rend="sup">th</seg>. till it come to the Vernal Equinox in the beginning of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi> And hence it is clear, that the Sun transits the Equinox twice in a year; declining from it once this way, another that way.</p>
               <p>The beginnings of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricorn,</hi> are called Solstices, because the Sun being (as it were) imoveable, there seeme to observe its stations: yet it must not be understood of its motion through the Ecliptick, but in respect of its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination from the Aequator: for part of the Ecliptick <hi>viz.</hi> some degrees before and after the beginnings of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> and <hi>Capricorn,</hi> are almost parallel
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:199139:30"/> to the Aequator; so that the Sun when it transits these parts, varies little or nothing its declination, and may be therefore judged as it were immove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>The proper motion of the Sun through the Ecliptick may be illustrated by this simile: set a little<note n="*" place="margin">To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the Sun.</note> fly upon the Globe, so that it may go along the Ecliptick line, from the West into the East; and so turn the Globe about its <hi>Axis,</hi> from the East into the West; and as oft as the Globe shall go about, the fly may go the contrary way one<note n="*" place="margin">Or a very small matter more or less.</note> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; so that the Globe turning 365. times upon its <hi>Axis,</hi> from the East to the West, the fly in the mean time goeth from the West into the East through all the signes of the Zodiaque.</p>
               <p>Concerning the courses of the other Planets which cannot be represented in the Globe, we shall not stand to dispute; only in general acquaint you, that <hi>Saturn,</hi> being next to the fixed stars, absolves his course in the space of 30. years; <hi>Jupiter,</hi> 12. <hi>Mars,</hi> 2. <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> (the constant Concomitants of the Sun) in 1. year; but the Moone in 27. days: And
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:199139:30"/> all these Planets go not as the Sun, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways under the Ecliptick; but go now into the North, then into the South; as the way of their proper latitude requires.</p>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:199139:31"/> the Heaven, according to our sight of the earth, and divideth it into two parts, is rather to be took according to the sense of the thing, then the truth: For to speak properly, and Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, this Circle divides not the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven into equal parts, because it doth not transite the Center of the world, and because the distance of the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the earth from the Center, (that is the semi-diameter of the earth) is not so much, that it can any way hinder (all impediments, as hills, trees, mountaines, &amp;c. being removed) the conspection of the very same mediety of the Heaven (for he that looks from a mountain sees more then the half of Heaven) therefore this visible circle is taken for the Horizon: And to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish it from the Mathematical is called<figure>

               <p>In this Scheam the lesser Circle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed about <hi>a</hi> the Center, is the Globe of the earth: <hi>a b</hi> its Semidiameter or the distance of the superficies <hi>b</hi> to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>a:</hi> the greater Circle <hi>d f g</hi> is the Sphere of the fixed stars, distant from the Center of the earth according to <hi>Alpharganus</hi> and others at least 22612.

But the heaven or the Sphere it self in respect of the Horizon
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:199139:33"/> is looked on by the inhabitants of the earth under a triple constitution: <hi>viz. Sphaera recta</hi>

                     <hi>Sphaera Parallela</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Or a Parallel Sphere.</note> and between these the <hi>Sphaera Obliqua,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Or Oblique Sphere.</note> it is called the direct Sphere, when both the Poles of the world ly upon the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon; and the Aequinoctial Circle is farthest remote from it passing through the <hi>Zenith,</hi> according to the following scheam; And in the position of this kind of Sphere, all the Celestial Bodies, <hi>Sun, Moon, Planets,</hi> and <hi>Fixed stars</hi> by the dayly turning about of the heaven, directly ascend above and descend be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Horizon, because the Circles which they make in the first motion are cut by it at right angles.</p>
                  <p>The constitution of such a Sphere is shown by the Globe thus, turn the brazen Meridian in the notch of the wooden Horizon, until the Poles or the extremities of the <hi>Axis</hi> touch the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon towards the North and South, and the Aequinoctial will transite the <hi>Zenith</hi> to the greatest remoteness from the Horizon; and if you turn the Globe thus placed, there will appear to your sight. 1. All the Circles stars and signes
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:199139:33"/> in the Globe which will ascend directly<figure>
                        <figDesc>diagram</figDesc>
                     </figure> to the East above the Horizon, and descend directly into the West beneath it. 2. All the stars or signes (whither they be neer to the Aequator, or far of) which ascend together over the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, will together likewise pass through the Meridian and be hid under the Horizon. 3. All these will spend as much time above the Horizon as they will do under it; because the Circles which they make by the turning of the Globe, are cut by the Horizon into two equal parts: And hence it is manifest, that the Sun as well in the Aequator as out of it, (towards the North or South more or less constituted,) by the dayly mocion of the heaven, stayeth an equal time both above and below the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon; and so the days are without any variation ever equal with the nights: This happens to those that dwel directly under the Aequator, without any lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude towards either Pole of the world; as the Inhabitants of the Iland of

                  <p>A Parallel Sphere is, when one Pole of the world is elevated above the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon to the <hi>Zenith;</hi> the other depressed as low as the <hi>Nadir,</hi> and the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial line is joyned with the Horizon, as appears in the following scheame. Therefore the stars by the turning of the heaven, neither get above the Horizon, nor go below it, but move with it always in a Parallel manner: This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears<figure>
                        <figDesc>diagram</figDesc>
                     </figure> thus. Turn the Globe with the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Meridian, so that one Pole may be in the <hi>Zenith,</hi> distant every way from the Horizon, 90. degrees; the other in the <hi>Nadir,</hi> and the Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial line about the Horizon: Then if you turn about the Globe, you will see. 1. All the stars, Circles, and other parts of the Globe, neither ascend above, nor discend beneath the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, but be turned with it Parallelly. 2. The North Pole being elevated, as long
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:199139:34"/> as the Sun passeth through the Northern Signes of the Zodiack (from <hi>March</hi> 10. to <hi>September</hi> 12.) it goes about above the Horizon, and never sets, and so makes a constant day of six moneths; and on the contrary from <hi>September</hi> 12. to <hi>March</hi> 10.) while it goes through the Southern signes, it dayly runs round beneath the Horizon, but never riseth, and so makes six moneths a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual night; this happens in those places of the earth that have 90. degrees of latitude, which is under each Pole, or in the points of the true North and South.</p>
                  <p>By the Oblique Sphere is understood such a constitution of the heaven in which the <hi>Axis</hi> of the world (being neither direct nor Parallel to the Horizon) is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined obliquely towards both sides of the Horizon; as in the scheame ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned: Therefore all the Celestial<figure>
                        <figDesc>diagram</figDesc>
                     </figure> Bodies have oblique and unequal Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and Descensions towards the Horizon; and this position of the Sphere is shown by the Globe, when
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:199139:35"/> the <hi>Axis</hi> doth not lie on the Horizon, nor is directly elevated, but inclines obliquely North or South towards the Horizon: whence it comes to passe, that so much as one of the Poles is elevated above the Horizon on the one side, so much the other is depressed under the Horizon on the other side. From such constitution of the Globe. 1. The Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator, and the other Circles, with the the signes and stars, will obliquely ascend above the Horizon, and descend again under it, not directly, as in the direct Sphere; nor Parallelly, as in the Parallel Sphere. 2. All the lines Parallel to the Aequator on both sides (even those which are made through the turning of the Sphere, by the Sun, stars, or other signes) you will see divided by the Horizon into unequal parts; so that of those which decline from the Aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor towards the elevated Pole, the greater part will be extant above the Horizon, the lesser obscured under it; but of those that tend towards the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed Pole, the greater part remain under the Horizon; the lesser extant (by the turning of the Sphere) above; Hence,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:199139:35"/> one may see, that when the Sun is out of the Aequator in a signe tending to the elevated Pole, it makes a great deal more of its course above the Horizon then under it, and remaines longer above the earth, making the days longer then the nights; on the contrary, when it enters the signes tending towards the depressed Pole, it spends lesse time above then under the Horizon, and consequently is not so long above the earth as under it, thereby making the days shorter then the nights: it is likewise manifest, that by how much the more either Pole is elevated above the Horizon, by so much the more unequally are the Circles cut; and thence is it, that there ariseth that differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that there is between the days and nights. 3. When the Sun is in the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator, it stays the same time above and beneath the Horizon, and so doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely measure out the day and the night; because the Equinoctial and Horizon (the greatest Circles) doe cut one another into equal parts; so that one part of the Aequator is always extant above it, the other, latent under it; though the Pole be more or lesse elevated

                     <hi>PROBLEME II.</hi> That the elevation of the Pole is equal to the latitude of places; and does with the altitude of the Aequator make 90. degrees.</head>
                  <p>FRom the constitution of the Oblique Sphere, among others, these two are worth our animadversion; first, that the altitude of the Pole is equal to the distance of the <hi>Zenith,</hi> from the Aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; or (which is all one) to the latitude of places. 2. That the altitude of the Aequator and the Pole, make together 90. degrees, and then one being deducted from 90. degrees, the residue shows the altitude of the other.</p>
                  <p>The first may be thus demonstrated by the Globe; joyn both Poles to the Horizon, as in the direct Sphere; and they will be without any elevation; and then the <hi>Zenith</hi> falls in the Aequator. Remove hence either of the Poles from the Horizon (for example) 10. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and the Aequator will descend contrarily from the <hi>Zenith</hi> so many degrees towards the Horizon: and by
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:199139:37"/> how much higher the Pole is elevated so much will the Aequator be declined from the <hi>Zenith;</hi> hence it appears, that the altitude of the Pole is alwaies equal to the distance of the <hi>Zenith,</hi> from the Aequator: or to the latitude of places in the Terrestrial Globe: The second may be known by the Globe the same way; When the Pole is elevated above the Horizon 20. degrees, the Equinoctial recedes so much from the <hi>Zenith:</hi> and is distant from the Horizon 70. degrees, the sum of which numbers added to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether is 90. degrees, if the Pole should be elevated 60. degrees, the Aequator declines so many degrees from the <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith,</hi> and is above the Horizon 30. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; which with the 60. make 90. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and so in the rest. It may be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematically demonstrated thus; in<figure>

                  </p>
                  <p>According to the second (I say) that <hi>e a</hi> the elevation of the Aequator, and the arch <hi>p d</hi> the elevation of the Pole, make together 90. degrees: For because the Semi-circle of the Meridian <hi>a e z p d</hi> contains twice 90. degrees, if the quadrant <hi>e z p</hi> (from the Aequator to the Pole 90. degrees) should be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted from the Semi-circle <hi>a e z p d,</hi> the remaining arches, to wit, <hi>a e</hi> (the elevation of the Aequator) and <hi>p d</hi> (the altitude of the Pole) will make to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether 90. degrees; And if you subduct the altitude of one from 90. degrees, that which remaines is the elevation of the other.</p>

                  <p>FIrst set the Globes on a table so that the upper superficies of the Horizon may be parallel with the true Horizon. Secondly erect the Pole so many degrees above the Horizon as the Latitude of the place contains: as at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> 52 ⅓. degrees, because that City hath 52 ½. North Latitude. Thirdly turn the Globes until the brazen Meridians agree with the lines of the North, and South in the Mariners compasse, (placed in the basis of the Horizon) so that the Northern Pole may respect the North, and the Southern the South; this being done, the Axis of the Globes will agree with the Axis of the world, and all the parts on the wooden Horizons (as East, West, North and South and other parts) with the places of the true Horizon. Fourthly apply the place proposed to the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial Meridian, and the scite of the

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:199139:40"/> toward the East; (that is the part a little more Easterly then what is called in the Marriners compasse South East and by East) in which point of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe <hi>Alexandria</hi> is placed in respect of <hi>Amsterdam.</hi> But if with the same diligence you number in the Quadrant of Altitude, the degrees betweene the Zenith, (that is <hi>Amsterdam</hi>) and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> you will have the shortest distance betweene both Cities, according to the greatest Circle.</p>
                  <p>If one place below the Horizon be distant above 90. degrees from the other, so as the Quadrant of Altitude can not reach it, as the City <hi>Limae</hi> in <hi>Peru</hi> is, do thus, <hi>Amsterdam▪</hi> being under the Meridian, looke whither <hi>Limae</hi> be more Eastward or Westward, and you shall find it in the West under the Horizon, then turn the Globe Eastward till <hi>Limae</hi> touch the Horizon: and (the Globe being fastened) you must at the opposite part of the Horizon (in a Diametrical line) make a mark on the Globe with a coal or a peece of chalk: then turn it to its former situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that <hi>Amsterdam</hi> may be at the

                  <p>Therefore in respect of <hi>Amsterdam, Limae</hi> is situated so many degrees in the opposite part of the Horizon, from the West into the South.

                  <p>LET the Globe be placed by the sixth Problem parallel with the Horizon, so as that the four corners (<hi>viz.</hi> East West North and South) of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon may agree with the four corners of the World; then to the degree of the Ecliptick the Sun is in that day, fasten with a little wax some small perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as the Spherick Gnomon, or a pin, but you must fasten it so as that it may cut the superficies of the Globe on every side at right Angles; that is, that the top of the perpendicular decline not more to one side of the Globe then to the other: then bring the degree of the Ecliptick the Sun is in to the Meridian; and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till full noon <hi>viz.</hi> that the Sun in the heaven be full in the South which you shall know by the shadow, for then it will not be on either side of the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, but directly under it: turn the Globe through the notch of the Horizon, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or downwards till the Spherick
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:199139:55"/> Gnomon or perpendicular project no shadow on any side of it, but seems to stand as it were upon the very shadow it self; and then the Pole of the Globe will be elevated so many degrees as is the Pole of the world in the heaven it self.</p>

                  <p>HAving by the last Probleme found the altitude of the Pole, you are to take care that the Globe be not moved from its former scituation, but that the Horizon and corners of it respond with the Horizon and corners of the World, as in the last Probleme: then at full Noon you must place the Spherick Gnomon or perpendicular, upon that degree of the brasen Meridian that the Sun can give no side-waies shaddow to, but that the shaddow may be just under the perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; and the degree of the Meridian the perpendicular is at is the degree of the Suns declination, whether Northward or
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:199139:55"/> Southward from the Equinoctial: but you must be sure the perpendicular cut the superficies of the Globe on every side at right Angles, when you make this operation.</p>
                  <p>Then turn the Globe till some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the Ecliptick lye directly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the observed degree of the Meridian; and that will be the place of the Sun in the Ecliptique for the day proposed.</p>

                  <p>And these ascensions and descensions are ever uniform, because the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the direct Sphear is onely one.</p>
                  <p>Now to find the Right ascension, bring the point proposed to the Meridian, and the number of degrees cut by the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian in the Equinoctial, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>Aries</hi> to the degree cut, will be the Right Ascension and Descension of that signe.

                  <p>CHuse a place of known latitude, as <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> (which Citie may serve in stead of all,) and inquire what hour the Sun riseth and sets on the 20.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:199139:64"/> of Iuly: first rectifie, the Globe for the Altitude of the Pole at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and bring <hi>Leo</hi> 7. deg. (the place of the Sun) to the Meridian,) then bring the Horary Index to the 12. hour, and turn the Globe till that degree touch the Horizon in the East, and the Index will point at 17▪ min. past 4. a clock, for the rising of the Sun: or turn the Globe till the place of the Sun touch the Horizon in the West, and the Index will show the 7. hour 43 min. after noon, for the setting of the Sun the day proposed.</p>
                  <p>Because the Aequinoctial contains 360. deg. which alwaies in a natural day of 24. houres passe through the Meridian, to wit, every houre 15. deg. and in every minute of time the fourth part of a degree. Therefore in all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemes, by the benefit thereof, the time may be found with more certainty then by the Index of the Horary circle, after this manner; in stead of an example let the Probleme proposed be taken to find the hour of the setting and rising of the Sun, on Iuly 20.</p>
                  <p>Apply the place of the Sun (which is the 7. deg. of Leo) to the East side of the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:199139:64"/> Horizon, and note the degree of the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator which is cut by the Meridian and you shall find 13. deg. 33. min. from the beginning of <hi>Aries,</hi> then turn the Globe till the place of the Sun touch the Meridian; and see in the Aequator what degree is under the Meridian, and you shall find 129. deg. 15. min. so that from the rising of the Sun till noone 115. deg. 42. min. of the Aequator shall passe through the Meridian; which 115. di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide by 15. (because 15. deg. make one hour) and you will have 7. hours, and the remaining degrees, which are 10. deg. 52 min. multiply by 4. (because every degree is 4. minutes of time) and there will more-over arise 43. horary minutes: reduct these 7. houres 43. min. from 12. the fore-going mid-night and there will remaine 4. houres 17. min. for the time of the rising of the Sun. Now to find the hour of Sun-set join the Suns place to the Meridian, and you shall see 129. deg. 15. min. of the Equinoctial under it. Then turn the Globe till the place of the Sun touch the Horizon in the West, and you shall see the Meridian cut 244. deg. 57. min. so that in the mean time
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:199139:65"/> 115. deg. 42. min. of the Aequator passes through the Meridian; divide these by 15. and multiply the remainder by 4. and there will be as before 7. houres 43. min. for the time that the Sun sets after noon.</p>

For an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of both, we will take Iuly 20. and October 26.</p>
                     <p>On the 20. of Iuly the Sun being in the 7. deg. of <hi>Leo,</hi> its Right Ascension is found by the 19. Probleme to be 129. deg. 25. min. its Oblique 103. deg. 33. min. the difference between both is 25. deg. 52. min. which makes by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:199139:65"/> rule 1. houre 43. min. and that being added to 6. houres (because the Sun is North from the Aequator) gives 7. houres 43. min. for the time of the Suns rising that day before noon, and setting after noon.</p>
                     <p>On the 26. of Octob. the Sun is found by the 9. Probleme to be in the 13. deg. of <hi>Scorpio,</hi> and its Right Ascension by the 19. Probleme 220. deg. 32. min. the Oblique Ascension 199. deg. 1. min. the Ascensional difference is 21. deg. 31. min. which makes one houre 26. min. which being deducted from 6. houres, because the Sun is Southerly from the Equinoctial there remains 4. houres 34. min. for the time which the Sun rises that day before noon, and sets after noon.</p>

                     <hi>PROBLEME XXVII.</hi> To find the beginning and ending of Nights, and Dayes, at all places and times, and also the beginning and end of Twilight.</head>
                  <p>THe day begins when the Sun ascends above the Horizon, and the day ends, and night begins when it descends under the Horizon; and yet darknesse does not presently follow the setting of the Sun in the evening, nor continue till the rising of the Sun in the morning; but it is light in the morning somwhat before Sun rising, and in the evening somwhat after Sun setting. The cause where of is, that the Sun in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, lying under the Horizon, casteth
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:199139:69"/> forth his beams into the ayr; now the Vapors which inviron our visible Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, forth-with produce or cause some whitenesse and clearenesse; and this we call Break of day, or morning Twilight: which clearenesse continually increasing, at length spreads it self through the Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith, even unto the West: but the time from which the Sun beginneth so to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the ayr in the morning or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake it at night is when it is 18. degrees under the Horizon, according to the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle Circle: If it be more then 18. deg. it is quite dark through the whole ayr, without any certain or doubtful light. In those places therefore where the Sun in Summer cannot descend to that depth under the Horizon, it is hardly night, but always twilight. Neverthelesse it is to be understood that it is not at all times and in all places twilight when the Sun is 18. degrees under the Horizon, because the various, temperature and height of the ayr causes twilight to begin and end sooner or later then they are wont; as you may understand by those Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors which do fully handle this matter.</p>
                  <p>That we may know when this light
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:199139:70"/> in the morning, which we call dawning or break of day, begins to spred into the ayr at any time of the year; we will take this Example to find at what hour it is at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> September 25. Therefore elevate the North Pole of the Globe to the height of the Pole of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> and bring the place of the Sun (which that day is in the 12. of <hi>Libra,</hi> to the Meridian, and the Index to the 12. hour on the South side: then turn the Globe into the East untill the opposite degree of the Ecliptick (which is here the 12. of <hi>Aries</hi>) be in the West elevated above the Horizon 18. deg. of the Quadrant of Altitude, and then the place of the Sun in the East will be depressed 18. deg. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Horizon; and (the Globe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maning unmoved, you shall see that) the Index shews the 4. hour 26. min. in the morning, (that is, after mid-night,) for the beginning of break of day. Then turn the Globe, until the 12. degree of <hi>Aries</hi> be again elevated 18. degrees of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant of Altitude above the Horizon in the East, and the Index will shew the 7. hour 34. min. after noon, for the time that twilight ends at night.</p>

                     <hi>PROBLEME XXVIII.</hi> To find out the threefold rising or setting of the Stars or signes, with the Sun, according to the description of Ancient Poets.</head>
                  <p>ANcient Poets, and rustick writers describe the Seasons of the year, as <hi>Spring, Summer, Autumn,</hi> and <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> by 3. diverse rising and setting of the signes and stars, which they call <hi>Cosmick, Acronick,</hi> and <hi>Heliack.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>Cosmical</hi> or morning rising, of a signe or star, is, when together with the Sun it climbeth above the Horizon. A <hi>Cosmical</hi> or morning setting when a signe or star setteth <hi>(ex adverso)</hi> with the rising Sun.</p>
                  <p>An <hi>Acronyck rising,</hi> which is both <hi>Chronick</hi> and <hi>Vespertine,</hi> is when a star or some sign riseth opposite to the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Sun. An <hi>Acronyck</hi> or <hi>Vespertine,</hi> is when together with the Sun a signe or stars descends below the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon.</p>
                  <p>From which it is manifest, that the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and all parts of the Zodiack, which set
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:199139:71"/>
                     <hi>Acronically,</hi> rise <hi>Cosmically;</hi> and on the contrary, that they that rise <hi>Chronically</hi> set <hi>Cosmically,</hi> according to this verse:
<q>
                        <p>Cosmice descendit signum quod Chronice surgit.</p>
                        <p>Chronice descendit signum quod Cosmice surgit.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which neverthelesse is much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent in fixed stars, for the stars whose latitude is North from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliptick, and which rise <hi>Cosmically,</hi> that is, when they rise with the Sun in an Oblique Sphere, (whose Northern Pole is elevated more then the Circle of the greatest Declination, of the Sun from the Aequator,) set not together with the Sun, <hi>Chronically,</hi> but long after the Sun. And on the contrary, those which are South from the Ecliptick (in such a position of the Sphere,) set before the Sun. But where the South Pole of the world is elevated so much above the Horizon, the courses or the former disposition of the stars are at some time of the year changed, and some signe of the Zodiack riseth <hi>Cosmically</hi> and setteth <hi>Chronically:</hi> we will take for example, the beginning of <hi>Leo:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:199139:71"/> seek in the Kalender of the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon the beginning of <hi>Leo,</hi> and you shall find against it the 13. day of July at which time the Sunne entreth that signe, and riseth which it <hi>Cosmically,</hi> and setteth <hi>Chronically.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you seek the <hi>Chronical</hi> rising, and <hi>Cosmical</hi> setting of this sign; take the place of the Ecliptick opposite to it, (which is the beginning of <hi>Aquarius,</hi> on the Horizontal Calender) and you shall find against it the 10. day of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, all which time the Sunne entring the beginning of <hi>Aquarius,</hi> causeth the beginning of <hi>Leo,</hi> then to rise <hi>Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> and set <hi>Cosmically.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If you would seek the same in a fixed star (at <hi>Amsterdam</hi>) the example shall be <hi>Arcturus.</hi> The Globe being set to the elevation of the Pole 52. deg. 23. min. join the star to the East side of the Horizon, and see what degree of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cliptick touches the Horizon: And you shall find 30. degrees of <hi>Virgo,</hi> with which the star riseth <hi>Cosmically.</hi> But the time when the Sunne doth enter the degree, is had by the precedent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemes, and is the 12. day of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</hi>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:199139:72"/> The opposite degree of the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, to wit, 30, of <hi>Pisces,</hi> is found to be possessed by the Sunne the 5. of <hi>March,</hi> which denotes the time when <hi>Arcturus</hi> riseth <hi>Acronically</hi> at <hi>Amster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To know the <hi>Acronical</hi> setting of this star, bring it to the West side of the Horizon, and look what degree of the Ecliptick touches the Horizon there, and it will be the 5. of <hi>Capricornus,</hi> which the Sunne possesseth the 16. of <hi>December;</hi> at which time the star setteth Chronically, The 5. degree of <hi>Cancer</hi> is opposite, which the Sunne is found to be in (by the precedent Problemes) on the 16. of June, when the star setteth <hi>Cosmically.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Heliack</hi> rising of a star (which may rather be called an apparition) is, when a star which was inconspicuous before, (by reason of its neerness to the Sun) (whose brightness suffers it not to be seen) getteth out of the Suns beams, by the retiring of the Sunne in the Ecliptick, and is discovered to sight. But this apparition of stars is made sooner in some stars then in others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their various magnitudes: stars
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:199139:72"/> of the first bigness are discovered (by common account) when the Sunne is hidden 12. deg. of the Vertical Circle under the Horizon; of the second bigness when the Sun is 13. deg. under the Horizon; of the third when 14. deg. of the fourth when 15. and so to 16. 17. 18. degrees.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Heliack</hi> setting of a star (which may be called more truely a hiding) is made when a star which before was conspicuous &amp; shining (by reason of his sufficient distance from the Sun, is by the Suns moving and approch in the Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick darkened, nor doth appear larger though the ayr be fair and clear.</p>
                  <p>To find out the <hi>Heliack</hi> rising of any star, (as of <hi>Arcturus</hi>) in the North lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of 52 ⅓.

                     <hi>PROBLEME XXIX.</hi> Concerning the Azimuth of the Sun and Stars, and how it may be found out.</head>
                  <p>AS in a terrestrial Globe the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians are drawn from one Pole to another, by the degrees of the Aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; so the Vertical Circles, called by
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:199139:73"/> the <hi>Arabians</hi> Azimuth, are drawn from the Zenith to the Nadir, by the degrees of the Horizon. They are described by the Quadrant of altitude on the Globe thus; fix one end to the Zenith, and the other may be applyed to all the parts of the Horizon, and the edge of the Quadrant of altitude describes an Azimuth Line.</p>
                  <p>The Azimuth of the Sun or stars, is the arch of the Horizon comprehended between the Meridian and that Vertical Circle which is extended out of the Zenith through the Center of the Sun or Star, even into the Horizon, (where all Azimuths are numbred) and is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, Easterly and Westerly: The Eastern Azimuth, which is numbred from the Meridian in the South towards the East, even to the Meridian in the North by 180. degrees. The Western which is numbred from the Meridian in the South towards the West, until it is gotten to the Meridian in the North, which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise makes 180. degrees.</p>
                  <p>To find out the Azimuth of the Sun or any star by the Globe, you must know first either the hour of the day, or the height of the Sun or star above
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:199139:74"/> the Horizon. Therefore to find the Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth of the Sun when the hour is given: we will propose at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> the 16. of <hi>May</hi> at eight a clock before noon; now the Globe being set to the elevation of that Pole, join the place of the Sun (which is 5. degrees of <hi>Gemini</hi>) to the Meridian, and the Index to the 12. hour then turn the Globe into the East, until the Index point at the 8. hour (or by the 22. Probl. until 60. deg. of the Aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor passe through the Meridian) there stay the Globe, and bring the Quadrant of altitude to the 5. deg. of <hi>Gemini,</hi> and note the degree that it cuts into the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, and you shall have the required Azimuth 79. degrees 36. min. from the South towards the East.</p>
                  <p>That you may find the same day at the 11<seg rend="sup">th</seg>. hour after noon, the Azimuth of <hi>Vultur,</hi> the bright star in <hi>Aquila,</hi> turn the Globe into the West, until the Index points at the 11. hour at night; and bring the Quadrant of altitude to the star on the East side, and that shews on the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon 83. degrees 11. min. (from the South Eastward,) for the Azimuth of that star at the time propounded. To find the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zimuth
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:199139:74"/> of any known altitude, the example shall be the 10. day of <hi>August,</hi> the altitude of the Sun above the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> before noon, was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to be 20. deg. The Globe being set to the elevation of the Pole at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam,</hi> turn the place of the Sun for that day to the East (which by the 9. Probleme is in the 27. deg. of <hi>Leo,</hi>) and bring the Quadrant of altitude to that degree; <hi>viz.</hi> the 27. of <hi>Leo;</hi> and then the Quadrant will shew in the Horizon 77. deg. 16. min. from the South towards the East. For the Azimuth of the Sun at the time propounded, the same way of working must be observed in fixed stars: as for example. In the same latitude the star in the heart of <hi>Leo,</hi> called <hi>Regulus,</hi> is observed to be in the West, at the altitude of 25. degrees, above the Horizon, therefore join that star to the 25. deg. upwards of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant of Altitude, and that will shew 79. deg. 47. min. in the Horizon from the South into the West, for the Azi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muth of that star at the altitude ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served.</p>

                     <hi>PROBLEME XXX.</hi> Concerning Almicantaraths, or Circles of Altitude, and how they may be found.</head>
                  <p>THe Circles of Altitudes called Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macantars are the lesser Circles drawn by Imagination about the Zenith (as if that were the Pole or Center) and are parallel with the Horizon; ascending upwards, and cut the Azimuth Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles every where (as the Parallels do the Meridians in the Terrestrial Globe) at right angles. These are described (in the Celestial Globe) by every point of the Quadrant of Altitude, if it be fixt to the Zenith, and be turned upon its own Center round about the Horizon. But that it may be found in which of these Circles the Sun or star is, that is, how high it is above the Horizon, you must either know the time of the day, or else observe the true Azimuth.</p>
                  <p>The time being known, for Example, at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> the 21. of <hi>April,</hi> at 9. a clock in the morning, the Almicantur or Altitude of the Sun above the Horizon, may be found thus; the Pole being
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:199139:75"/> erected to that Altitude, join the place of the Sun, (which on that day is in the 11. deg. of <hi>Taurus</hi>) to the Meridian, and the Index to the 12<seg rend="sup">th</seg> hour at noon; then turn the Globe to the East untill the Index point at the 9. hour before noon, (or till 35. deg. of the Aequator pass through the Meridian,) and bring the Quadrant of altitude to the place of the Sun, and on it number upwards from the Horizon to the place of the Sun, and you shall find 38. deg. 54. min. for the height of the Sun or Almicantarath Circle, which the Sun toucheth at the time given.</p>
                  <p>Proceed so likewise in the stars; for Example, seek the altitude of the Bright star in the Harp, above the Horizon at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> on the same day, at 11. hours after noon; the place of the Sun being applyed to the Meridian, and the Index to the 12. hour) turn the Globe into the West till the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex shew the the 11. hour at night (or may passe 11. times 15. (that is 165.) deg. of the Aequator through the Meridian) then bring the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant of altitude to the foresaid
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:199139:76"/> star, and on it number from the Horizon upwards to the star, and you shall have 39. deg. 27. min. for its altitude at the hour given. Likewise by the known Azimuth (which may be found by the Mariners Compasse, or other Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for that purpose) to find the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micantarath of the Sun or stars, you must proceed thus. Bring the place of the Sun (the 21. of <hi>April,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to be in the point South East, that is in the Azimuth of 45. deg. from the South into the East) to the Horizon, and also bring the lower end of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant of altitude to the Horizon at 45. deg. from the South into the East, (to wit the Azimuth observed,) and turn the Globe so long till the place of the Sun, which is the 11. deg. of <hi>Taurus,</hi> touch the place of altitude; and on that number from the Horizon upwards, and you shall find 44. deg. 47. min. for the altitude of the Sun, or Almicantarath Circle which it toucheth that day, in that part of the Horizon.</p>
                  <p>For fixed stars, Take the bright star in the Eagle, (observed to be in the point East South East) that is, in 67. deg.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:199139:76"/> and ½. from the South into the East) Therefore bring the Quadrant of altitude to the Horizon, so many degrees distant from the South Eastward, and join the star to the Quadrant of altitude, and you shall find it elevated above the Horizon in the Verticle Circle 26. deg. 3. min. for the Almicantarath of the star.</p>

                     <hi>PROBLEME XXXII.</hi> How you may know the stars in Heaven, by the use of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial Globe.</head>
                  <p>IF you would know any star in the Heaven, as for example, the bright star in the great Dog, called <hi>Syrius;</hi> you may perceive it above the Horizon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the East &amp; South point, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore place the Globe by the foregoing Probleme, according to the situation of Heaven, which you may do either by the benefit of the Azimuth, or else by the altitude of the star, and so fix it: what stars soever of the Globe you desire to know in Heaven, (whether it be the Bright-star in the lesser dog, or <hi>Cor Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> or the heads of <hi>Gemini,</hi> all which are to be seen at the same time in the Eastern hemisphear of the heaven) you must apply to the Quadrant of altitude, and look in the Horizon what Azimuth it hath, and in the Quadrant of altitude what height it has above the Horizon: both which you must keep in mind; then erect the Index in the Astrolabe, or Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:199139:78"/> or (where you have a free Horizon) The Transversary of the Jacobs staf to the altitude found, and turning your face to the Azimuth of the star) by the help of the Instrument, you shall meet with it, and easily discern it (when it comes in view) from others.</p>
                  <p>If you know no star: set the Globe by the foregoing Probleme to the posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Heaven, that day and hour where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you desire to know the stars. (For example: at <hi>Amsterdam</hi> the 13. of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> at 9. of the clock at night,) the hour being come, look round about you for the brightest, and most eminent stars; and you shall find neer the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, among others, three bright stars in a straight line neer one another, the more Eastward of which is lower then the other: then look what stars are neer to the Meridian in the Globe, in such a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, and you shall find them to be in the girdle of <hi>Orion.</hi> But that you may be surer of it, observe the altitude of one of the three above the Horizon, suppose the middle-most, and you shall find it neer 36. deg. number therefore 36. deg. in the South part of the Meridian, of up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:199139:79"/> from the Horizon, and you shall find in the end of the number, the middle-most of the propounded stars.</p>
                  <p>Look a little higher in the Heaven, and you shall see two great and bright stars, further distant from one another; one whereof is more Eastward, the other more Westward: which when you have sought in the Globe, you shall find them placed on each shoulder of <hi>Orion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About the same distance below the Girdle as the two stars in <hi>Orions</hi> shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der are above his Girdle, you shall find likewise two bright stars in the Heaven, having a little more distance between themselves, then the two in the shoulders have; finding these in the Globe, you shall discern the Eastern to be in the right knee of <hi>Orion,</hi> the Western shining in the lest foot called <hi>Rigel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the same time a shining star is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerned in the Heaven, neer about 18. deg. distant from the South, and elevated almost 20. deg. above the Horizon to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the East. Therefore that you may know what star it is, bring the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant of altitude to the Horizon about
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:199139:79"/> 18. deg. from the South towards the East; &amp; on it number almost 20. deg. upward, and you shall meet with one called <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> one of the greatest and most shining stars in the Heaven, whereby you may be sure you know it. Some of the chief fixed stars being known, it is easie to find out others by them; and that two waies; fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

By formes, because some are placed in a straight line, some in a quadrangle, some in a triangle, and others in some other figure. The three Bright stars in the Eagle make a straight Line, and direct that sight almost into the Bright star of the Harp. The stars in the face of the Bull, called <hi>Hyades,</hi> whereof the chief is <hi>Aldebaran,</hi> make the form of a Bee hive or pontifical Crown. The three greater in <hi>Pegasus,</hi> together with the head of <hi>Andromeda</hi> make a very great quadrangle. The 5. bright ones in the Swan make a great crosse. Four in the Dolphin make an oblong circle. And the North Crown makes almost a whole circle.</p>
                  <p>Stars are known by their distances af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:199139:80"/> this manner. See on the Globe by the Quadrant of altitude how many degrees the unknown star is distant from the known, for example: search how many degrees the bright star of the Harp is distant from <hi>Vultur,</hi> the brightest star in the Eagle; and you shall find 34 deg 12. min. then fit the Transversary on the Iacobs staf, to the observed distance of 34. deg. 12. min. and the end of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex being joined to your Eye, direct one end of the Transversary towards the most Easterly of the three stars in the Eagle, the other towards the most Northerly, for the drawing of a straight line, which the three foresaid stars in the Eagle make, which straight line being extended will point to the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned bright star in the Harp, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou maist know that the star that stands in a straight line with the three in the Eagle, is the bright star in the Harp. Do thus in other stars.</p>

If you would know how high the Sun is above the Horizon, the 21. of <hi>May,</hi> at 9. a clock before noon, joyn the place of the Sun (which on that day is in the 11. deg. of <hi>Taurus</hi>) to the Meridian, and the Index to the 12. hour, and turn the Globe toward the East, till the Index shews the 9. hour before noon; or (if you desire to work by a greater Circle) till 45. deg. of the Equinoctial transit the Meridian by the 22.

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:199139:87"/> (keeping the Globe stedfast) bring the Quadrant to the place of the Sun, and the lower end of it will cut 60. deg. 42. min. of the Horizon, numbred from the South towards East, for the Azimuth of the Sun: and the number of degrees in the Quadrant between the Horizon and the place of the Sun being. 38. deg. 41. min. is the Altitude of the Sun at the time required.

                  <p>BEcause the Sun doth accomplish his Diurnal motion about the earth in 24. hours, it is certain that it is mid-night, with those which live under our Meridian, in the opposite Hemisphear of the earth, when with us it is mid-day: and likewise that it is noon with those which live in the middle between us, (that is 90. deg. of longitude distant from us Eastward,) when with us it is 6. a clock in the morning, and that it is noon with
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:199139:88"/> those which are so many degrees of the Aequator Westward, when with us it is 6. a clock at night.</p>
                  <p>That it may be known how much every place of the earth by it self should differ from the place given, in hours and minutes of hours; joyn the place given on the Terestrial Globe to the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, and the Index to the 12. hour: then turn the Globe, till the other place comes also to the Meridian; and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex will shew the horary distance sought for between both places. Or by the 3. Probleme seek the difference of longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and divide it by 15. and the Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient will shew the difference of time as before. If the place proposed be East from your habitation, the Sun comes to the Meridian so much sooner; but if West, so much later.</p>
                  <p>And if you would know what a clock it is at any strange place of the earth, you may know by this example. When it is 2. of the clock afternoon at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> I would know what a clock it is at <hi>Bantam,</hi> a City in the Isle of <hi>Java</hi> in the East-Indies: Therefore I bring <hi>Amsterdam</hi> to the Meridian, and

                  </p>
                  <p>If you would know what a clock it is at <hi>Lima,</hi> in the Region of <hi>Peru,</hi> at that moment (the Index being set as before) bring <hi>Lima</hi> to the Meridian, and that will shew the 7. hour. 56. min. from mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, which is the hour at that time, in the propounded City.</p>

                  <p>IN times past with the <hi>Jews, Greeks,</hi> and ancient <hi>Romanes,</hi> were used hours differing from these hours as we
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:199139:91"/> use at this time: for our hours as well by day as by night, are alwayes of an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual length throughout the year; to wit, 24. parts of a Natural day, numbring from mid-night to mid-night; but their hours were alwayes unequal, for they divided the day, how great soever it was, into 12. hours; reckoning from the rising to the setting of the Sun; and the night, from the setting to the rising of the Sun.</p>
                  <p>But such daies (in all regions that are far from the Aequator towards the Poles of the world) are alwaies unequal, as well the fore going as following day; likewise these hours are alwaies unequal, by reason of the difference which happens between those dayes: Mention is made of such hours in ancient Histories, and Holy Writ, the 20. Chap. of <hi>Matth.</hi> the 11. of <hi>John,</hi> and in some other places.</p>
                  <p>To find out the quantity of an une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual hour every day or night of the year, do thus; bring the place of the Sun that day to the East side of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, and see what degree of the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator is cut by it (that is, how much the oblique▪ Ascension of the Sun is) and keep that in your mind; from hence
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:199139:92"/> bring the place of the Sun to the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, and see what degree of the Aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor the East side of the Horizon cuts, and count the number of degrees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the former degree of the Aequator which you bore in mind, and it; which number of degrees divide by 6. because 6. unequal hours are precisely accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished from the rising of the Sun till noon, and the quotient will shew how many degrees of the Aequator passe through the Meridian, for every une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual hour of the day.</p>

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:199139:92"/> Meridian, it hath ascended above the Horizon (or past through the Meridian) 115. deg. 22. min. of the Aequator: which being divided by 6. 19. deg. and almost 19. min. of the Aequator are allowed, for the length of an unequal hour, which exceeds the equal hour 4. deg. and almost 19. min. that is, 17. mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes of time and a little more. So much as the unequal hour exceeds the equal by day, so much by night it is lesser then the equal, therefore if 17. min. should be substracted from the equal hour, 60. min. there would remain 43. min. for the length of the unequal hour by night, at the time propounded.</p>
                     <p>If you will know the unequal hour of the day, by the given Azimuth, or by the observed altitude of the Sun above the Horizon; you must first bring the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant to the degree of the Azimuth in the Horizon, and then join the place of the Sun to the given Azimuth, or altitude observed; then if it be before noon, see how many degrees of the Aequator are contained between the Oblique Ascension of the Sun (before known) and the point of the Aequator which

                  <p>BEcause the wooden Horizon by reason of its Latitude may hinder the raies of the Sun, therefore it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in this Probleme, that you take the Terrestrial Globe out of it▪ and hang it by a thred fastened to the Zenith of the Place that you enquire after, in such a manner, as that the raies of the Sun may have a free access to the body of the Globe: then fasten one thred to the extremity of the North, and another to the extremity of the South side of the Meridian, and with those two threds you may fasten the Globe, so as that its Meridian may respect the true Meridian, and its Poles the true Poles of Heaven; then bring the place enquired after, to he Meridian, and the Globe will be

I How the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Globe like the true one will have one Hemisphere inlighted, and the other shaddowed, and as it were in darkness. II. That it is day at that time in all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions scituated in the inlightned Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphere, and night at the same time in all places scituated in the shaddowed Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphere.

VI. If the light doth comprehend or exceed either of the Poles (which comes to pass, when the Sun passes through the Northern signes of the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack, about the Artick Pole; acom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing the same through Southern signes, about the Antarctick Pole) the places comprehended by the interval circle, described by the excesse of the Suns light above the Pole, have the Sun at that time not setting, but continual day.

                  <p>BY the 48. Probleme, join that place over whose Zenith the Sun is to the Meridian, for example; <hi>Surrat</hi> in the Indies, (under the North latitude, of 21. degrees) and fix the Quadrant to it then turn it through the Horizon, and you will find all places subjected to the Suns degrees, have the Sun in the same altitude above the Horizon; because they see it equidistant from their Zenith. For example, those places which are scituate
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:199139:99"/> under that Circle which the eightieth degrees of Quadrant describes, by the Circumvolution thereof observe the Sun together at that time also elevated 80. deg. above the Horizon. But they who are under the Circle from the 70. deg. of the Quadrant, likewise see the Sun in height 70. degrees. And so from one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to another or lesser parts of the Quadrant, if you please. Therefore because all places, as well of longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, as of another under the Circle (whether more or lesse) from the Suns place as it were in the described Center of the Zenith, observe the Sun at the same time, so high above the Horizon; it is to be noted, in all latitudes (of 10, 20, 30, degrees or more or less) equally Northwards or Southwards from <hi>Surat,</hi> that the Sun at noon on that day, is of an equal altitude, as in the latitude of 20. and 22. degrees; so likewise is it in the latitude of 15. and 27. deg. 5. and 37. and also in the 10. Southern degrees, and 52. North degrees; this only being the difference, that the more Southern places see the Suns place from the Zenith to the North, but the more Northern
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:199139:99"/> places see the Sun from the Zenith to the South.</p>
                  <p>But because the Sun seems alike ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated above the Horizon in diverse lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, which either cursively, or together on both sides, are North or Southward from the Aequator; it not only happens at noon when the Sun is under the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian, but at some other hours of the day.</p>

                     <p>If you desire to know under what la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude the Sun is the 30. of <hi>May</hi> at 9. in the morning, that is, 3. hours before noon, the longitude being alike, the Sun is observed to have the same Altitude as at <hi>Amsterdam:</hi> joyn that City to the Meridian, and the Index to the 12. hour, and turn the Globe towards the West, till the Index shew the 3. hour (or for the 3. hours passe through the Meridian 45. deg. of the Aequator) and then rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon the Suns Declination that day, which is 21. deg of the Meridian from the Aequator towards the North, and mark the end of the number, which will be in the Suns place, then turn the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:199139:100"/> Globe about, till <hi>Amsterdam</hi> stand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Meridian again, and there fix it.</p>
                     <p>This being done, apply the lower end of the Quadrant to the very Eastern point in the Horizon, and presse down the upper end in the Meridian, until its edge marked with deg. cut the said mark, or the Sun, and the upper end of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant will shew in the Meridian 30. deg. 58. min. from the Aequator to the North; but because the latitude of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam</hi> is 52. deg. 23. min. Northward, the foresaid place in the Meridian differs 21. deg. 25. min. from the Zenith of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam.</hi> Therefore count so many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees from the Quadrant in the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, towards the South, and the end of your numbring will fall upon 9. deg. 33. min. of latitude, for the place to which the Sun at that time hath a like altitude above the Horizon with <hi>Amsterdam.</hi>

Therefore those two places (like two Zeniths or points of the Quadrant) are equidistant from the foresaid mark, which denotes the Sun; and by consequence, the Sun in those two places hath an equal altitude above the Horizon. But because the Quadrant applyed to the East, and drawn through the place of the Sun as is said, doth from thence perpendicularly apply towards the Meridian (as the Meridian out of the Pole happens upon the Aequator) therefore from hence it appears, that not onely the foresaid two places at one &amp; the same time have the Sun of one neerness to their Zenith; but also al other places which are under the same Meridian, whither neerer to, or further from the Quadrant, for the Quadrant having this applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the latitude of 30. deg. 58. min. the places 1. deg. more Northward or Sou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>From hence you may note, how much they erre which hope that they can find out the elevation of the Pole at all hours of the day, by the altitude of the Sun above the Horizon.

                  <p>But because <hi>Amsterdam</hi> is about 10. deg. more Westward then <hi>Frankford,</hi> to whose longitude the Ephemerides are calculated; it is noted by the 42. Prob. if when it is 10. a clock at night at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam,</hi> then it is 10. and 40. min. at <hi>Franckford.</hi> Therefore if I inquire what
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:199139:102"/> was the disposition of the Planets in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven according to the longitude of <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> at that time I shall also have their disposition at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> precisely to the 10. hour. We will try that according to the Moon, that it may be an example in others. The 29. of <hi>December</hi> at noon, the Moon at <hi>Franckford</hi> is in the longitude of 12. deg 10. min. of <hi>Taurus,</hi> but at noon the day following, in the longitude of 24. deg. 55. min. of the same sign: The difference is 12. deg. 45. min. in longitude, which the Moon passeth through in the space of 24. hours. Therefore I say, by the common rule, if the Moons motion be 12. deg. 45. min. in 24. hours, how many degrees will be her motion in 10. hours and 40. min? you shall find it to be 5. deg. 40. min. adde those to the longitude of the Moon on the 29. of <hi>December,</hi> and you shall have 17. deg. 50. min. of <hi>Taurus</hi> for the longitude of the Moon to the time propounded. The latitude of the Moon to the 29. <hi>December</hi> is 3. deg. 12. min. To the 30. 3. deg. 58. min. both Northward from the Ecliptick, the difference is 46. min. therefore I say
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:199139:103"/> again, if the latitude of the Moon be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased 46. min. in 24. hours, how much will it be increased in 10. hours and 40. min? the product will be 20. min. which being added to 3. deg. 12. min. (because the latitude is increasing) 3. deg. 32. min. is the product for the Northern latitude of the Moon, to the time given. Follow the same manner of working in all the other Planets, and you shall find their scituation and constitution in heaven the foresaid 29. of <hi>December</hi> at 10. of the clock at night at <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> to be thus.</p>

                  <p>Therefore that you may transferre these their places on the Globe, place it so (by the 33. Probleme) that the Ecliptick may agree with the Horizon,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:199139:103"/> and its North Pole with the Zenith; and the Quadrant being fixed to the Zenith fasten the Globe to its station, and note the Planets which have North latitude, and then place the Planets on the Globe to the time given, after this manner.

                     <hi>AStrologers</hi> (who treat of the powers and influences that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly bodyes have upon the earthly, and conceive that they can fore-tel future events by the face of Heaven,) divide the whole Heaven into 12. parts, which they call <hi>Houses.</hi> This division is made by the six great Circles, (as it were) passing through two points opposite to one another, as the two Poles in Heaven are; to wit, the common intersections of the Horizon and Meridian, towards the North and South. The chief of them are the Meridian, and Horizon, which alwayes divide the Heaven into four Parts: the other four are thus shown; by the Circle of Position two Quadrants of the Equinoctial being above the Horizon, are each of them divided into 3. equal parts; to which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, the Circle of Position (whose ends as the Poles) are fastened to the two intersections of the Horizon
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:199139:105"/> and Meridian) is lifted up, and by this reason, each of the Quadrants of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven above the Horizon is divided into 3. parts (which are called <hi>Houses</hi>) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Horizon and Meridian, so that both the Quadrants above the Horizon, make six <hi>Houses;</hi> and the parts opposite to them make the 6. remaining <hi>Houses</hi> under the Horizon. By these Circles the Aequinoctial is divided into 12. equal parts, and the Ecliptick into so many unequal parts: But the greatest account is had of the unequal parts, for they are particularly marked, as the bounds and marks of the beginning of each <hi>House.</hi> As for the order of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering the <hi>Houses,</hi> you must take the beginning from the East, and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon downwards beneath the Horizon, so that the first six are alwaies under the Horizon, and the other 6. above it. Four of them are of greater account then the rest: The first, which is called the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roscope,</hi> or Ascendant, which taketh its beginning from the East side of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon: The fourth, from the Meridian under the Horizon in the bottome of heaven: The 7. from the West side of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:199139:105"/> the Horizon: The 10. from the Meridian in the top or middle of heaven. For when the Celestial bodies apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to those, they have a greater power and operation. These twelve Houses are represented by the following Figure of 12. Triangles.</p>

(beginning from the Right Ascension of the Sun at 267. deg. 2. min.) this being done, fix the Globe, and fasten the Circle of Position to its Poles, for the West side of the Globe. Then looking in the Aequinoctial, you shall find at the intersection of the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, on the West side, 267. deg. 2. min. which is called the Oblique Descension of the seventh House.

Afterwards apply the Circle of position to the Meridian on the East side of the Globe, and from thence number in the Aequinoctial the 3. part of the Quadrant or 30. deg. and you shall have the Oblique Ascension of the 11.

               <p>THere are two sorts of Sun-dyals, that is to say, Pendent and Fixed: Pendent are they which being hung by the hands and turned to the Sun or stars, shew the hours of the day and night; and those are such, in which we either use<note n="*" place="margin">Or sight.</note>

Of these there are also two sorts, to wit, those which are made either on a plane surface, or on a Spherical, being either Concave or Connex.</p>
               <p>It is not my mind to describe here all kind of Dyals, and how many ways they may be made; for that would require a large volume: but onely how some of the most eminent may be described on a plane surface by helpe of the Globes, which may serve as a foundation to all others of this nature; and which being well understood, every one exercised in Arethmetick and Geometry, shall easily understand, not onely in what manner these may be made, but also how all others may be made as well by lines as numbers, according to his own desire. Sun-Dyals on plain superficies are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and are distinguished by their names, according to the Celestial Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles with which their planes are Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel.
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:199139:110"/> Among these are Horizontal Dyals, which being placed level, are Parallel to the Horizon; and whose upper face do directly behold the Zenith.</p>

               <p>Upright Decliners are such as swerve from the North or South towards the East or West, and are Parallel to that Verticle Circle or Azimuth which descends from the Zenith to the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon beyond the points of East and West; as are all upright Wals that decline from the South or North towards the Coasts of South West, South East, North East, and North West.</p>

                  <p>IN the drawing of Dyals, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, that a direct upright Plane, is Parallel to the Horizontal; and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the Sphere, is one and the same
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:199139:119"/> with this Caution, that they differ 90 degrees of Latitude under the same Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian; as for example, an upright Dyal to the North Latitude of 52. degrees, is the same with a Horizontal Dyal to the South Latitude of 38. degrees, and for as much as Horizontal Dyals for the same Latitudes (as well to the Southward as to the Northward of the Aequinoctial, as to the draught of the hour lines) are like each to other; it hence follows, that if a Horizontal Dyal be made to the Latitude of 38. degrees, without respect of North or South Latitude; the same (so far as concernes the hour lines) is like unto an upright Dyal made for the Latitude of 52. degrees. Also an Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal Dyal to the Latitude of 60. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, is like unto an upright Dyal made for the Latitude of 30. degrees, and so for others. From whence it further fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that an Horizontal and an upright direct Dyal for the Latitude of 45. deg. are both one and the same, only with this difference, that the numbers which in Horizontal Dyals (made for a North Latitude) were to be accounted from the right hand towards the left, are now

Then turn the Globe again till 15. deg. more of the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator passe under the Meridian towards the West, or till the Index come to the second hour after noon, and look in
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:199139:121"/> what place the Colure cuts the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant of Altitude, and you shall find 18. deg. 3. min. Likewise number then from C towards B, and set a mark at the end thereof, through which from A draw a line which will shew the second hour after noon. Proceed after the same manner for the other hours after noon, and you shall find that the Colure cuts the Quadrant of Altitude in the 25. deg. 37. min. from the Zenith downwards for the third hour; for the fourth hour in 33. deg. 37. min. for the fifth in 42. deg. 10. min. for the sixth in 53. deg. 20. min. and for the seventh in 68. deg. 57. min. number these arches as the two foregoing from C towards B, and from the Center A draw straight lines through those marks, and you shall have all the after noon hour lines, which a plane or Dyal of this kind can admit of. To find the fore noon hours, remove the Quadrant of Altitude to the Eastern side of the Meridian, and bring the lower end of it in the Horizon so many degrees from the East towards the South, as the wall declines from the South towards the West, to wit 35. degrees:
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:199139:121"/> again, bring the Colure to the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, and the Index to the 12. hour.

<pb n="234" facs="tcp:199139:122"/> the style ought not to be placed over the hour line of 12. nor at the same Altitude as in a direct erect Dyal, but over another line and at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Altitude.

Then observe these two things, namely how many degrees of the Quadrant of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude are contained between the Zenith and the Colure; and how many degrees in the Colure are contained between the Quadrant of altitude and the Pole: you shall find, for the first on the Quadrant of altitude between the Zenith and the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure, 23. deg. 51. min. and so much is the distance between the substylary line and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:199139:122"/> the hour of 12. Then number in one Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drant from C towards B 23, deg. 51. min. and out of A through the said arch draw the straight line A E; which will be the substylar, over which the style ought directly to hang. For the second, set a mark at the arch, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Colure is not graduated where the Quadrant of Altitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de makes the intersection) and turn the Globe till you bring the mark under the Meridian; and you shall find 30. deg. between it and the Pole, for the elevation of the style: Wherefore from the substylar A E, number 30. deg. towards B, even unto H; and through H draw a straight line from A, which is A F; and an other at right angles from the substylar, which is E F; then the Triangle as A E F, erected upon the line A E; A F will shew with oblique or upper side the hours, and will likewise point towards the Pole.</p>

                  <p>BEtween direct Reclining or Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Dyals, and direct upright Dyals, the difference is no other in the manner of making but the latitude of the places where they stand. For how much the direct reclining Dyal leans back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, also how much the direct incliner stoops forwards, so much it differs in the height of its style from the direct erect Dyal. For Example: A Plain that stands directly South in the Latitude of 50. deg. reclining 10. deg. is no other then an upright direct Dyal for the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of 60. deg. Likewise in the Latitude of 50. deg. a Plane inclining 10. deg. differs not from a direct upright Dyal to elevation of the Pole or Latitude of 40. deg. It therefore an upright direct Dyal be made for the Latitude of 40. deg. (by the 57. Proposition) the same is also a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect recliner for the Latitude of 30. deg. and a direct incliner to the Latitude of 50. deg. the arch of Re / In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination being 10. degrees.</p>

Then set the Pole of the Globe to the Latitude of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterdam,</hi> 52. deg. 23. min. and bring the Colure to the Meridian, and the Index to the hour of 12. and the Quadrant of Altitude on the North side 24. deg. from the Meridian towards the East, namely so much as is the Declination of the Plane from the South towards the West. Then get a thinne Semi-Circle of smooth brasse, or of any other bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing solid matter, like the Quadrant of Altitude, and divide the same into 180. degrees, and bring one end thereof to the Horizon at 24. deg. from the East towards the South, the other so many deg. from the West towards the North, but fasten the middle of it at the distance of 10. deg. from the Zenith, being as much as the flat or Plane whereon the Dyal is to be made doth recline down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards toward the Horizon on the North side: which being done, observe in what place the brasse Meridian cuts the Semi-Circle, and you shall find at 4. deg. 25. min. distant from the Zenith; reckon these on the Plane from C to B,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:199139:129"/> and through the end of the said arch from the Center A, draw a straight line, which will be for the hour line of 12. To find the after noon hours, turn the Globe Westwards, till 15. deg. of the Aequator passe under the Meridian, or till the Index shews the hour of 1. in the after noon; and mark where the Colure cuts the Semi-Circle, and you shall find 11. deg. 12. min. number these from C to B▪ and draw a straight line from the Center A through the end of the said arch, and the said line will represent the hour of 1. in the after noon. Do the like for the rest of the after noon hours, and you shall find the Colure will cut the Semi-Circle in 17. deg. 23. min. from the Zenith for the hour of 2. and for the hour of 3. at 23. deg. 50. min. for the hour of 4. in 31. deg. 16. min. for the hour of 5. in 41. deg. 5. min. for the hour of 6. in the 55. deg. 52. min. and lastly for the hour of 7. in 80. deg. 23. min. Reckon these arches severally in the Quadrant from C towards B, and draw straight lines through them from the Center A, so shall you find all the after noon hours. Then to find the fore
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:199139:129"/> noon hours, bring the Colure again to the Meridian, and the Index to the hour of 12. and turn the Globe Eastward, till 15. deg. of the Aequator passe under the Meridian, or till the Index point out the hour of 11. (which is all one,) then the Colure will cut the Semi-Circle in 3. deg. 55. min. on the East side of the Azimuth of the plane; and working after the same manner for all the rest of the hours, you shall find that the Colure cuts the Semi-Circle for the hour of 10. in 15. deg. 39. min. by numbring from the middle thereof; For the hour of 9. in 34. deg. 29. min. for the hour of 8. in 64. deg. 43. min. Reckon these arches from C to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards D, and out of the Center A draw straight lines through them, and you shall have all the fore noon hours de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed. In like manner all the hour lines will be drawn which such a plane is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of. Then know where and how high the style of such a Dyal is to be placed: let the brass Semi-Circle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as aforesaid, and turn the Quadrant of altitude to the other side of the Globe, placing the lower end thereof 24. d. from the South towards the West, being as
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:199139:130"/> much as is the Declination of the Plane, then turn the Globe till the Colure cuts the Quadrant of Altitude 10. degrees above the Horizon, being as much as is the Reclination of the Plane; Then the Globe remaining stedfast, the Colure will cut the Semi-Circle at right angles. This being done observe two things; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely, first how many degrees are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained between the middle of the Semi-Circle and the Colure; secondly, how many degrees are contained in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure between the Semi-Circle and the Pole; and you shall find for the first 15. deg. 48. min. But if the Colure be not divided into degrees, set a mark at the place where it and the Semi-Circle cut each other, and turn the Globe till you bring the Colure under the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian, and you shall find for the second arch 24. deg. 18. min. between that mark and the Pole. Count the former number 15. deg. 48. min. from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular A C towards B, and through the end of the same from the Center A draw a straight line for the sub-stylar as A E; and reckon the latter arch 24. deg. 18. min. from the sub-stylar
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:199139:130"/> towards B even unto H, and through H draw a straight line from the Center A, which is A F, and another straight line from the line A F, as here E F: the Trigone A E F made by these three lines being raised perpendicularly over the sub-stylar A E, the slope side A F, will point to the Pole, and the shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of that side will shew the hour of the day.</p>
                  <p>The manner of finding the hour lines for a Reclining Plane Declining to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the East, is one and the same; but only that the Quadrant of altitude in the former example which was placed in the Horizon from the North towards the East, and from the South towards the West, is to be placed in this contrary; namely, from the North towards the West, and from the South towards the East: in like manner the Semi-Circle in stead of being placed there from the East towards the South, and from the West towards the North, is in this case to be placed in the Horizon, from the East to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North, and from the West towards the South. Also the hour of 12. and the style of the Dyal is to be drawn

To find the other hours, turn the Globe to the East for the forenoon hours, to the West for the afternoon hours, till for every hour 15. deg. of the Aequator passe under the Meridian; and observe where the Colure cuts the Semi-Circle; and you shall find at 2. deg. 41. min. towards the East for the hour of 11. and at 15. deg. 6. min. for the hour of 10. at 26. deg. 4. min. for the hour of 9. at 38. deg. 22. min. for the hour of 8. at 50. deg. 28. min. for the hour of 7. at 63. deg. 53. min. for the hour of 6. at 79. deg. 1. min. for the hour of 5.

               <p>The difference between Journies on shore and Voyages at Sea is very great: For all Land journies and distances are conceived to lye directly from one place to another, according to the draught of some great Circle of the Sphere, which is supposed to cut all the Meridians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween both places, at divers angles; but of Sea Voyages which are performed by
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:199139:143"/> Sayling, some are straight, some circular, but the greatest part crooked and Winding like an Helix, or Spiral line, according to the Way or Rumb of the Mariners Compasse. Straight Voyages are such as when we sayl towards the North or South, under the Meridian; or East and West, under the Aequinoctial: Circular, as when we sayl East or West, without the Aequinoctial, under some Parallel, cutting all the Meridians at right angles: Spiral or bending Courses are such, as when we sayl upon some other point of the Compasse, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from the Aequinoctial either Northwards or Southwards, approach nearer and nearer to one of the Poles.</p>
               <p>And this happens, because a Ship being steered by the Compasse (the needle whereof being touched by the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, by vertue thereof, alwaies points towards the North) upon some certain point or Rumb, either towards the South, North, East, or West, describes (as it were) crooked bending or Spiral lines, which alwaies intersect and cross the Meridians, how many soever they are imagined to be, at the same oblique
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:199139:143"/> angles; These kind of Courses to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish them from direct sayling under the Meridian, Aequinoctial, or Parallels, are called Rumbs, named as follows, beginning at the North; the first East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, is called North and by East; the second N N E; the third, N E by N; the fourth N E; and so for the rest, which we shal not here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat; But he that desires fully to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand their nature and use, with the manner of drawing them on the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial Globe, let him peruse the works of <hi>Petrus Nonius, Edward Wright,</hi> but chiefely of <hi>Simon Stevinius, in quarto libro Geographiae:</hi> We shal only here handle their use in Navigation, so far as concerns the Terrestrial Globe.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>EXperience shews, that the Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Needle in the same place, doth alwaies shew and point towards the same Coast of the World, but not the like in all places; for in some places it points directly North; in other places it declines from the North into the East; and in other places it varies from the North to the West. But although this variation of the Needle is not of very great moment in short Voyages, as from hence into <hi>Swedeland, Russia, France, Spain,</hi> or other bordering places; and therefore in these Voyages is commonly neglected, especially seeing some Sea Charts are in a manner fitted to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation: notwithstanding it is not to be neglected in greater Voyages through the vast Ocean, but ought diligently to be observed and considered; seeing that ships are steered by the Mariners
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:199139:149"/> Compasse, as their only guide, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish their Voyages according to the guidance thereof; which by reason of the hidden vertue of the Magnetick Needle, from the true North divers ways, sometimes Eastward otherwhiles Westward, swerves even to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of two Rumbs or points of the Compasse, from the true North; from whence it is manifest, that Ships steered by the guidance of the said Magnetick Needle, may err also so much from the intended Voyage. How much this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the Magnetick Needle is in divers places of the earth, and which way it swerves from the true North, we will passe by as impertinent, and not ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to our purpose; and shall only shew how the same may be observed by the Globe.</p>
                  <p>To effect this, observe by such a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe which hath the Magnetick Needle placed directly towards the North, under the Flour de Luce, in what am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude or degrees of the Compasse the Sun rises in the morning, or sets at night; and find by the 18. Probleme the true Amplitude of the Suns rising or setting
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:199139:150"/> for the day given. Then if the rising or setting of the Sun in the Compasse and Globe agree together, the Needle shews the true North, without any variation: But as much as the same rising in the Compasse is more Northward, then his true amplitude, so much the Needle va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries from the North Eastward, and as much as it is more Southward, so much the Needle declines from the North Westward: Contrarily in the seting, as much as the Sun sets more Northwards then the true amplitude, so much the Needle declines into the West, and as much as it is Southwards, so much the Needle swerves into the East.</p>

                     <p>The 10. of May under the Northern latitude of 40. deg. I observe the same to rise by such a Compasse whose Needle lyes directly under the Flour de Luce 37. deg. from the East Northwards; but by the 19. Probleme, I find that it ought to rise in such latitude, 26. deg. 37. min. from the East Northwards; therefore because the difference here is
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:199139:150"/> 10. deg. 23. min. that the Sun by the Compasse rises more Northwardly then the truth; by consequence the point of East, points so much from the true East Southwards, also the Needle and Flour de Luce varies so many degrees and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, from the North Eastwards.</p>

                  <div type="example">
                     <head>Another Example by the Amplitude of the Sun at his setting.</head>
                     <p>For the same day and latitude, I find that the Sun by the Globe sets at night 26. deg. 37. min. from the West North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. But observing the Sun by the Compasse, I find that he sets only 16. deg. 14. min. from the West Northward; difference is 10. deg. 23. min. that the Rumb or point of West in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe points neerer to the North then the truth, therefore also the Needle varies so much from the North Eastward.</p>
                     <p>The variation of the Needle, also may be found at any time, of the day by the height of the Sun; for example the 27. of June in the North latitude of 52. deg. 23. min. the Sun being 22. deg. high, I find (by the 34. Probleme) that the Sun is in the Azimuth of 9. deg. 2. min. from
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:199139:151"/> the East Northwards, but observing by the Compasse, I find that he is only 4. deg. from the East, Northward: so that the difference here is 5. deg. 2. min. that the Sun by the Compasse appears more Eastwards then the truth; or (which is the same) I see that the East Rumb is too neer to the North by 5. deg. 2. min. and by consequence the Needle varies so much from the North Westward. You may use the same manner of work, in the afternoon for any height of the Sun, but such observations as are made when the Sun is at a good distance from the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian, are the most exact.</p>

               </head>
               <p n="1">1. URSA MINOR. This Constellation hath the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence, because it is nearest of all the rest unto the North Pole; And is called of the Greeks <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; whereupon the Pole is called the Pole Arctick, for that it is neer unto that Constellation. It is also called <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice minor,</hi> because of the smal revolution which it maketh round about the Pole:
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:199139:152"/> or rather of <hi>Elice,</hi> a Town in <hi>Arcadia,</hi> wherein <hi>Calysto</hi> the great Bear, and mother to the less, was br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d. It is called <hi>Cynosura,</hi> because this Constellation, though it carry the name of a Bear, yet it hath the tail of a Dog. Last of all, it is termed <hi>Phoenice,</hi> because that <hi>Thales,</hi> who first gave the name to this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation, was a <hi>Phoenicean:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> being taught how to use it in their Navigations, did call it by the name of the Countrie wherein <hi>Thales</hi> was born. It consisteth of 7. stars, which the Latines call <hi>Septemirio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;</hi> because by their continual motion, those seven stars do as it were wear the heavens. The <hi>Spanjards</hi> call them all <hi>Bosina,</hi> that is, an <hi>Horn;</hi> because they may be very well brought into that form, whereof that which is in the end of the tail, is called the <hi>Pole-Star,</hi> by reason of the neareness thereof unto the Pole of the world: for it is distant (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of most) from the true Pole, but 23. deg. 30. min. the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians call it <hi>Alrukaba:</hi> And of the <hi>Scythians</hi> it is said to be an <hi>Iron nail,</hi> and is worshipped by them as a God.
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:199139:152"/> The two stars that are in the shoulders of the <hi>Bear,</hi> are called <hi>Guards,</hi> of the Spanish word <hi>Guardare,</hi> which is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold; because they are diligently to be looked unto, in regard of the singular use which they have in Navigation.</p>
               <p>The reason why this Constellation was brought into the Heavens, is divers<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly set down, and first in this manner. <hi>Saturn</hi> having received of the Oracle that one of his sons should banish him out of his Kingdom, determined with himself to kill all the men children that he should beget: whereupon he gave command to <hi>Ops</hi> his wife, being then great, that she should shew him the child so soon as ever it was born: But she bringing forth <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and being greatly delighted with his hair, gave the childe unto two Nymphes of <hi>Crete,</hi> dwelling in the mount <hi>Dicte;</hi> whereof this was one, and was called <hi>Cynosura;</hi> the other was <hi>Helice. Jupiter,</hi> after that (according to the Oracle) he had bereft his Father of the Kingdom, in recompence of their paines and courtesie, translated them both into the Heavens, and made of them two Constellations; the <hi>Lesser Bear,</hi> and the <hi>Greater Bear.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="300" facs="tcp:199139:153"/>
               <p>Other some say, that it was <hi>Arcas,</hi> the son of <hi>Calysto;</hi> and they tell the tale on this manner. <hi>Calysto</hi> a Nimph of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular beauty, daughter to <hi>Lycaon</hi> King of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> induced by the great desire she had of hunting, became a follower of the Goddess <hi>Diana.</hi> After this, <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> being enamoured with her beauty, and out of hope, by reason of her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, to win her love in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, counterfeited the shape of <hi>Diana,</hi> lay with <hi>Calysto,</hi> and got her with childe; of whom was born a son, which was called <hi>Arcas. Diana,</hi> or rather <hi>Juno,</hi> being very much offended here-with, turned <hi>Calysto</hi> into a <hi>Bear. Arcas</hi> her son at the Age of fifteen, hunting in the woods, by chance lighted upon his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the shape of a <hi>Bear:</hi> who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her son <hi>Arcas,</hi> stood still, that he might come near unto her, and not be afraid: but he fearing the shape of so cruel a Beast, bent his bow of purpose to have slain her: Whereupon <hi>Jupiter</hi> to prevent the mischief, translated them both into Heaven, and of them made two several Constellations: unto the <hi>lesser Bear,</hi> there belongs but one star unform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:199139:153"/>2. URSA MAIOR, the <hi>Greater Bear,</hi> called also of the Greeks <hi>Arctos,</hi> and <hi>Helice,</hi> consisteth of 27. stars: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the which, those seven that are in the hinder part and tail of the Bear, are most observed; the Latines call them <hi>Plaustrum;</hi> and of our men they are called <hi>Charles Wayn;</hi> because the stars do stand in such sort, that the three which are in the tail resemble the Horses, and the other four which are in the flank of the <hi>Bear,</hi> stand (after a manner) like the Wheels of a Waggon, or Chariot; and they are supposed by some to be greater then the Sun. The reason of the Translation of this Constellation into the Heaven, is at large set down in the other Constellation, and therefore needs not here to be repeated. This Constellation was first invented by <hi>Nauplius</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Palamedes</hi> the Greek, and in great use among the Grecians; and this is to be noted both in this and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Constellation, that <hi>they never set under the Horizon in any part of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope:</hi> which though it fall out by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their scituation in the Heavens; yet the Poets say, that it came to pass
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:199139:154"/> through the displeasure and hatred of <hi>Juno;</hi> who for that she was by <hi>Calysto</hi> made a Cukquean, and they notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing (as she took it) in despight of her, were translated into Heaven, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quested her brother <hi>Neptune,</hi> that he would never suffer those stars to set with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Kingdom: To which request <hi>Neptune</hi> condescended: so that in all <hi>Europe</hi> they never come neer unto the Sea, or touch the Horizon. If any one marvel, that (seeing she hath the form of a <hi>Bear</hi>) she should have a tail so long; Imagine that <hi>Jupiter</hi> fearing to come too nigh unto her teeth, laid hold on her tail, and thereby drew her up into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; so that she of her self being very weighty, and the distance from the Earth to the Heaven very great, there was great likelyhood that her tail must stretch. The unformed stars belonging to this Constellation are eight.</p>
               <p n="3">3. DRACO, the <hi>Dragon,</hi> of some named the <hi>Serpent,</hi> of others the <hi>Snake,</hi> by the <hi>Arabians, Aben;</hi> and by <hi>Juncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Florentinus, Vrago;</hi> because he windeth his tail round about the Ecli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptick Pole; it containeth 31. stars. This
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:199139:154"/> was the Dragon that kept the Golden Apples in the Orchard of the Hesperides, (now thought to be the Islands of <hi>Cape de Verde</hi>) and for his diligence and watchfulness, was afterwards translated into heaven: Yet others say, that he came into Heaven by this occasion; when <hi>Minerva</hi> withstood the <hi>Gyants</hi> fighting against the <hi>Gods;</hi> they to terrifie her, threw at her a mighty <hi>Dragon;</hi> but she catching him in her hands, threw him presently up into Heaven, and placed him there as a memorial of that her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance. Others would have it to be the Serpent <hi>Python,</hi> whom <hi>Apollo</hi> slew after the Deluge.</p>
               <p n="4">4. CEPHEUS containeth in him 11. stars, and hath two unformed. This was a King of the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> and Husband unto <hi>Cassiopeia,</hi> and father of <hi>Andromeda,</hi> whom <hi>Perseus</hi> married. He was taken up into Heaven, with his wife and daughter, for the good deserts of <hi>Perseus</hi> his son in law; that he and his whole stock might be had in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance for ever. The star which is in his right shoulder, is called by the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians, <hi>Alderahiemin; i. e.</hi> his right Arm.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:199139:155"/>5. BOOTES, <hi>the driver of the Oxen</hi> (for so I suppose the name to signifie, rather then an <hi>Herdsman;</hi> for he hath not his name because he hath the care of any cattel, but only because he is supposed to drive <hi>Charles his Wain,</hi> which is drawn by 3. Oxen) he is also called <hi>Arctophilax,</hi> the <hi>keeper of</hi> the <hi>Bear,</hi> as though the care of her were committed unto him. This Constellation consisteth of 22. stars. Some will have <hi>Bootes</hi> to be <hi>Arcas,</hi> the son of her who before was turned into the <hi>Great Bear;</hi> and they tell the tale thus. <hi>Lycaon</hi> the father of <hi>Calysto,</hi> receiving <hi>Jupiter</hi> into his house as a guest, took <hi>Arcas</hi> his daughters son, and cut him in pieces; and among other services, set him before <hi>Jupiter</hi> to be eaten: for by this means he thought to prove if his guest were a God, as he pretended to be. <hi>Jupiter</hi> perceiving this heinous fact, overthrew the table, fired the house with lightning, and turned <hi>Lycaon</hi> into a Wolf: but gathering, and setting together again the limbs of the child, he committed him to a Nymph of <hi>Aetolia</hi> to be kept: <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi> afterwards coming to mans estate,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:199139:155"/> and hunting in the woods, lighted at unawares upon his mother, transformed by <hi>Juno</hi> into the shape of a <hi>Bear,</hi> whom he pursued into the Temple of <hi>Jupiter Lycaeus,</hi> whereunto by the law of the <hi>Arcadians</hi> it was death for any man to come. For as much therefore as they must of likelyhood be both slain, <hi>Calysto</hi> by her son, and he by the law; <hi>Jupiter</hi> to avoid this mischeif, of meer pity took them both up into heaven. Unto this Constellation belongeth but one star un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and it is between the leggs of <hi>Bootes,</hi> and by the <hi>Grecians</hi> it is called <hi>Arcturus,</hi> because of all the stars neer the <hi>great Bear</hi> named <hi>Arctos,</hi> this star is first seen neer her tail in the evening. The Poetical invention is thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Icarus</hi> the father of <hi>Erigone,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received of the God <hi>Bacchus</hi> a flaggon of wine, to declare how good it was for mortal men, travelled therewith into the Territories of <hi>Athens,</hi> and there began to carouse with certain shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds: they being greatly delighted with the pleasantness of the wine, being a new kind of liquor, began to draw so hard at it, that ere they left off, they were
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:199139:156"/> past one and thirty; and in the end, were fain to lay their heads to rest. But coming unto themselves again, and finding their brains scarce in good temper, they killed <hi>Icarus,</hi> thinking indeed that he had either poysoned them, or at the least wise made their brains intoxicate. <hi>Erigone</hi> was ready to die for grief, and so was <hi>Mera</hi> her little dog. But <hi>Jupiter</hi> to allay their grief, placed her father in heaven between the legs of <hi>Arcto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philax.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. CORONA BOREA, the <hi>Northern garland,</hi> consisteth of eight stars; yet <hi>Ovid</hi> saith, that it hath nine. This was the Garland that <hi>Venus</hi> gave unto <hi>Ariadne,</hi> when she was married unto <hi>Bacchus</hi> in the Isle <hi>Naxus,</hi> after that <hi>Theseus</hi> had forsaken her: which Garland, <hi>Bacchus</hi> placed in the Heaven as a token of his love. <hi>Novidius</hi> will have it to be the <hi>Crown of the Virgin Mary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. ENGONASIS: This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation hath the name, because it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed under the shape of a man kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the one knee, and is therefore by the Latines called <hi>Ingeniculum.</hi> It
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:199139:156"/> containeth 29. stars, and wanteth a proper name, because of the great diversity of opinions concerning the same. For some will have it to be <hi>Hercules,</hi> that mighty Conquerour, who for his 12. labours was thought worthy to be placed in the heaven, and nigh unto the <hi>Dragon</hi> whom he overcame. Others tell the tale thus: That when the <hi>Tytans</hi> fought against the <hi>Gods,</hi> they for fear of the <hi>Gyants,</hi> ran all unto the one side of the heaven: whereupon the Heaven was ready to have fallen, had not <hi>Hercules,</hi> together with <hi>Atlas</hi> set his neck unto it, and stayed the fall: and for this desert, he was placed in the Heaven.</p>
               <p n="8">8. LYRA, the <hi>Harp,</hi> it containeth 10. stars, whereof thus goeth the Fable. The River <hi>Nilus</hi> swelling above his bankes, overflowed the Country of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> after the fall whereof, there were left in the fields divers kinds of living things, and amongst the rest a <hi>Tortoise; Mercury,</hi> after the flesh thereof was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, the sinews still remaining, found the same, and striking it, he made it yeild a certains sound: whereupon he made an <hi>Harp</hi> like unto it, having 3. strings,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:199139:157"/> and gave it unto <hi>Orpheus</hi> the son of <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siopea.</hi> This <hi>Harp</hi> was of such excellent sound, that Trees, Stones, Fowls, and wild Beasts are said to follow the sound thereof. After such time therefore that <hi>Orpheus</hi> was slain by the women of <hi>Thrace,</hi> the Muses by the good leave of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and at the request of <hi>Apollo,</hi> placed this <hi>Harp</hi> in Heaven. <hi>Novidius</hi> will have it to be the <hi>Harp</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> whereby he pacified the evil spirit of <hi>Saul.</hi> This Constellation was afterwards called <hi>Vultur Cadens,</hi> the <hi>falling Grype:</hi> and <hi>Falco,</hi> the <hi>Falcon;</hi> or <hi>Tympanum,</hi> the <hi>Timbrel.</hi>

                  <pb n="309" facs="tcp:199139:157"/> and, as it were for his more safety, crept into her bosome. The woman not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who it was under that shape, but holding (as she thought) the <hi>Swan</hi> fast in her armes, fell a sleep: In the mean while <hi>Jupiter</hi> enjoyed his pleasure; and having obtained that he came for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took him again unto his winges; and in memorial of his purpose attained under that form, he placed the <hi>Swan</hi> among the stars.</p>

                  <hi>Ovid</hi> calleth this Constellation <hi>Milvius,</hi> the <hi>Kite,</hi> and telleth the tale thus. The Earth being greatly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with <hi>Jupiter,</hi> because he had driven <hi>Saturn</hi> his father out of his Kingdom, brought forth a monstrous <hi>Bull,</hi> which in his hinder parts was like a <hi>Serpent;</hi> and was afterwards called the <hi>Fatal Bull;</hi> because the <hi>Destinies</hi> had thus decreed, that whosoever could slay him, and offer up his entrails upon an Altar, should overcome the eternal Gods. <hi>Briareus</hi> that mighty Gyant, and ancient enemy of the Gods, overcame the Bull, and was ready to have offered up his entrails according to the decree of the <hi>Destinies:</hi> But <hi>Jupiter</hi> fearing the event
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:199139:158"/> commanded the Fowls of the Air to snatch them away: which although to their power, they endeavoured, yet there was none of them found so forward and apt to that action as the <hi>Kite,</hi> and for that cause he was accordingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with a place in Heaven.

This was the wife of <hi>Cepheus,</hi> and mother of <hi>Andromeda,</hi> whom <hi>Perseus</hi> married, and for his sake was translated into Heaven, as some write. Others say that her beauty being singular, she waxed so proud, that she preferred her selfe before the <hi>Nereides,</hi> which were the <hi>Nymphs of the Sea:</hi> for which cause, unto her disgrace and the example of all others, that in pride of their hearts would advance them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves above their betters, she was placed in the Heaven with her head as it were downwards, so that in the revolution of the Heavens, she

               <p>In this Constellation there are two other particular Constellations to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; whereof the one consisteth but of one star alone, which is in the left shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Auriga,</hi> and is called <hi>Hircus,</hi> or <hi>Capra,</hi> the <hi>Goat;</hi> the <hi>Arabians</hi> call it <hi>Alhaiot:</hi> The other consisteth of two little stars a little beneath the other, stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were in the hand of <hi>Auriga;</hi> this Constellation is called <hi>Haedi,</hi> the <hi>Kids.</hi> The tale is thus <hi>Saturn</hi> (as you heard before) had received of the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, that one of his sons should put him out of his Kingdom, whereupon he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to devour them all: <hi>Ops</hi> by stealth conveyed away <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and sent him to <hi>Melissus</hi> King of <hi>Crete</hi> to be nourished: <hi>Melissus</hi> having two daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Amalthaea</hi> and <hi>Melissa,</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Some say that it is <hi>Hercules,</hi> and report the tale on this manner. <hi>Juno</hi> being a great enemy to <hi>Hercules,</hi> sent two snakes to kill him, as he lay sleeping in his Cradle: but <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> being a lusty childe (for <hi>Jupiter</hi> had spent two daies in begetting him) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:199139:160"/> much ado, strangled them both: In memorial of so strange an event, <hi>Jupiter</hi> placed him in the heavens, with a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in his hands.</p>
               <p n="14">14. SERPENS, the <hi>Serpent</hi> of <hi>Ophiuchus,</hi> which consisteth of 18. stars. Some say that it is one of the Serpents that should have slain <hi>Hercules</hi> in his Cradle. <hi>Novidius</hi> saith, it is the <hi>Viper</hi> that bit <hi>Paul</hi> by the hand. Others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the tale in these words; <hi>Glaucus</hi> the son of <hi>Minos</hi> King of <hi>Crete,</hi> was by misfortune drowned in a Barrel of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. <hi>Minos</hi> his father craved the help of <hi>Aesculapius</hi> the Physitian: And that he might be driven perforce to help the childe, he shut him up in a secret place, together with the dead carcass; while <hi>Aesculapius</hi> stood in a great maze with himself what were best to be done, upon a sudden there came a Serpent creeping towards him; the which Serpent he slew with the staff which he had in his hand. After this there came another Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent in, bringing in his mouth a certain herb, which he laid upon the head of the dead Serpent, whereby he restored him unto life again. <hi>Aesculapius</hi> using
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:199139:161"/> the same herb, wrought the same effect upon <hi>Glaucus.</hi> Whereupon (after that) <hi>Aesculapius</hi> (whom some affirm to be <hi>Ophiuchus</hi>) was placed in the heaven, and the <hi>Serpent</hi> with him.</p>
               <p n="15">15.

The Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical reason of this Constellation, is this; <hi>Jupiter</hi> transforming himself into the form of an Eagle, took <hi>Ganimides</hi> the <hi>Trojan Boy,</hi> whom he greatly loved, up into heaven, and therefore in signe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (because by that means he performed his purpose) he placed the figure of the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:199139:161"/> Eagle in the Heaven. There belong unto this Constellation 6. stars (before time) unformed, but now brought into the Constellation of <hi>Antinous.</hi> But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon that name should come, I know not, except it were that some man devised it there, to curry favour with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Adrian,</hi> who loved one <hi>Antinous Bithynicus</hi> so well, that he builded a Temple in his honour at <hi>Mantinea.</hi>

               <p n="17">17. DELPINUS, the <hi>Dolphin:</hi> It containeth 10. stars; yet <hi>Ovid</hi> in his second Book <hi>de Fastis,</hi> saith that it hath but nine. Neither did the ancient Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers attribute unto it any more, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the number of the Muses; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of all other Fishes, the <hi>Dolphin</hi> is said to be delighted with Musick. The tale goeth thus concerning this Constel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. When <hi>Neptune</hi> the God of the Sea greatly desired to match with <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitrite,</hi> she being very modest and shamefaced, hid her self: whereupon he sent many messengers to seek her out, among whom, the <hi>Dolphin</hi> by his good hap, did first find her; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded her also to match with <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptune:</hi> For which his good and trusty

               <p>Others say, that when <hi>Bacchus</hi> had transformed the Mariners that would have betrayed him, into <hi>Dolphins,</hi> he placed one of them in Heaven, that it might be a lesson for others to take heed how they carried any one out of his way, contrary both to his desire, and their own promise. <hi>Novidius</hi> referreth this Constellation unto the Fish which saved <hi>Jonas</hi> from drowning.</p>
               <p n="18">18. EqUICULUS, is the little Horse, and it consisteth of 4. stars.

                  <hi>Jupiter, Neptune,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling upon the earth in the likenesse of men, were requested by <hi>Hyreus</hi> to take a poor lodging at his house for a night: they being overtaken with the evening, yeilded unto his request; <hi>Hyreus</hi> made them good cheer, killing an <hi>Oxe</hi> for their better entertainment: The Gods seeing the good heart of the old man,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:199139:164"/> willed him to demand what he would in recompence of his so freindly cheer. <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus</hi> and his wife being old, requested the Gods to gratify them with a Son. They to fulfil his desire, called for the hide of the Oxe that was slain, and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, they put it into the earth, and made water into it all three together, and covering it, willed <hi>Hyreus</hi> within ten moneths after to digge it out of the earth again; which he did, and found therein a man-childe; whom he called <hi>Ourion, ab Urina,</hi> of pisse; although afterwards by leaving out the second letter, he was named <hi>Orion.</hi> At such time therefore as he was placed in Heaven, this flood was joyned hard to his heeles, and the Oxe hide wherein the Gods did pisse, was set in his left hand, in memorial of his Off-spring.</p>

               <p>In times past there was not a <hi>Hare</hi> left in Isle <hi>Leros:</hi> a certain youth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of that Island, being very desirous of that kind of beast, brought with him from another country there about, an <hi>Hare</hi> great with young; which when she had brought forth, they in time became so acceptable unto the other Countri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that every one almost desired to have and keep a <hi>Hare.</hi> By reason where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the number of them grew to be so great, within a short space after, that the whole Island became full of <hi>Hares,</hi> so that their masters were not able to find them meat: whereupon the <hi>Hares</hi> breaking forth into the fields, devoured their corn. Wherefore the inhabitants being bitten with hunger, joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with one consent, and (though with much ado) destroyed the <hi>Hares. Jupiter</hi> therefore placed this Constella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Heaven, as well to express the exceeding fearfulness of the beast, as also to teach men this lesson; that there is nothing so much to be desired in this life, but that at one time or an other it

<pb n="326" facs="tcp:199139:166"/> to <hi>Tobias</hi> Dog, which may very well be, because he hath a tail; and <hi>Tobias</hi> Dog had one; as a certain fellow once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded: because it is written that <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bias</hi> his Dog fawned upon his master, therefore it is to be noted (said he) that he had a tail. The Poets say, that this is the Dog whom <hi>Jupiter</hi> set to keep <hi>Europa,</hi> after that he had stolen her away, and conveied her into <hi>Crete,</hi> and for his good service was placed in Heaven. Others say, that it was one of <hi>Orion</hi> his Dogs; There belong unto this Constellation 11. stars unformed.</p>
               <p n="6">6. CANIS MINOR; the <hi>Lesser Dog;</hi> this of the Greeks is called <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon,</hi> of the Latines <hi>Ante Canis;</hi> it containeth but two stars. Some say, that this also was one of <hi>Orions</hi> Dogs. Others rather affirm it to be <hi>Mera,</hi> the Dog of <hi>Erigone,</hi> or rather of <hi>Icarius</hi> her father, of whom mention is made in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation of <hi>Bootes</hi> and <hi>Virgo.</hi> This Dog of meer love to his master being slain, as is aforesaid, threw himself into the river <hi>Anygrus,</hi> but was afterward translated into Heaven with <hi>Erigone.</hi> Among the Poets there is great dissention which of
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:199139:166"/> the two should be the Dog of <hi>Erigone;</hi> some saying one, and some the other, and therefore they do many times take the one for the other.</p>
               <p n="7">7. ARGO NAVIS, the <hi>Ship Argo,</hi> which comprehendeth 41. stars; this is the Ship wherein <hi>Jason</hi> did fetch the Golden Fleece fron <hi>Colchis,</hi> which was afterward placed in Heaven as a memorial, not only because of the great Voyage, but also, because (as some will have it) it was the first Ship where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in any man sayled. Their reason why this Ship is not made whole is, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men might be put in mind not to despair, albeit that their Ship miscarry in some part now and then. Some avouch it to be the <hi>Ark</hi> of <hi>Noe. Novidius</hi> saith it is the Ship wherein the <hi>Apostles</hi> were, when Christ appeared unto them walking on the Sea. In one of the <hi>Oars</hi> of this Ship, there is a great star called <hi>Canopus,</hi> or <hi>Canobus,</hi> which the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians</hi> called <hi>Shuel,</hi> as it were a bone-fire, because of the greatness thereof. It is not seen in <hi>Italy,</hi> nor in any Country on this side of <hi>Italy.</hi> Some say that <hi>Canobus</hi> the master of <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelaus</hi>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:199139:167"/> his Ship, was transformed into this star.</p>
               <p n="8">8. HYDRA, the <hi>Hydre;</hi> this hath 25. stars, and two unformed.</p>
               <p n="9">9. CRATER, the <hi>Cup,</hi> or <hi>standing piece;</hi> this hath seven stars. Some say that this was the cup wherein <hi>Tagathon,</hi> that is, the chief God, mingled the stuff whereof he made the souls of men.</p>
               <p n="10">10. CORVUS, the <hi>Crow;</hi> this hath seven stars. These 3. Constellations are to be joyned together, because they depend upon one History, which is this. Upon a time <hi>Apollo</hi> made a solemn feast to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and wanting water to serve his turn, he delivered a cup to the <hi>Crow</hi> (the bird wherein he chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted) and sent him to fetch water therein: The <hi>Crow</hi> flying towards the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, espyed a figtree, fell in hand with the figs, and abode there till they were ripe: In the end, when he had fed his fill of them, and had satisfied his longing, he bethought himself of his errand, and by reason of his long delay, fearing a check, he caught up a snake in his bill, brought it to <hi>Apollo,</hi> and told him that the snake would not let him fill the <hi>Cup</hi> with
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:199139:167"/> water. <hi>Apollo</hi> seeing the impudency of the bird, gave him this gift, that as long as the figs were not ripe upon the tree, so long he should never drink: and for a memorial of the silly excuse that he made, he placed both the <hi>Crow, Cup,</hi> and <hi>Snake,</hi> in Heaven.</p>
               <p n="11">11. CENTAURUS, the <hi>Centaure,</hi> which comprehendeth 37. stars. Some say, that this is <hi>Typhon,</hi> others call him <hi>Chiron,</hi> the Schoolmaster of those three excellent men, <hi>Hercules, Achilles,</hi> and <hi>Aesculapius;</hi> unto <hi>Hercules</hi> he read <hi>Astronomy;</hi> he trained up <hi>Achilles</hi> in Musick, and <hi>Aesculapius</hi> in Physick: and for his upright life, he was turned into this Constellation. Yet <hi>Virgil</hi> calleth <hi>Sagittarius</hi> by the name of <hi>Chiron.</hi> In the hinder feet of this Constellation, those stars are set which are called the <hi>Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siers,</hi> appearing to the Mariners as they sail towards the South Sea, in the form of a crosse, whereupon they have their name. The four stars which are in the Garnish of the <hi>Centaures</hi> Spear, are accounted by <hi>Proclus</hi> as a peculiar Constellation, and are called by him <hi>Thyrsilochus,</hi> which was a Spear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:199139:168"/> about with Vine leaves: but they are called by <hi>Copernicus</hi> and <hi>Clavius,</hi> and other Astronomers, the stars of his Target. It should seem that they were deceived by the old translation of <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mee,</hi> wherein <hi>Scutum</hi> is put for <hi>Hasta, i. e.</hi> the Target for the Spear, as it is well noted by our Countryman M. <hi>R. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,</hi> in his Book intituled the Castle of knowledge.</p>
               <p n="12">12. LUPUS, the <hi>Wolf,</hi> or the beast which the <hi>Centaure</hi> holdeth in his hand, and containeth 19. stars; the Poetical reason is this. <hi>Chiron</hi> the <hi>Centaure</hi> being a just man, was greatly given to the worship of the Gods: which thing, that it might be notified to all posterity, they placed him by this beast, which he seemeth to stick, and thrust through with his Spear, (as it were) ready to kill for sacrifice.</p>
               <p n="13">13. <hi>Ara,</hi> the <hi>Altar,</hi> it is also called <hi>Lar,</hi> or <hi>Thuribulum, i. e.</hi> a Chimney with the fire, or a Censor. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth of seven stars, and is affirmed of some Poets, to be the <hi>Altar</hi> whereon the <hi>Centaure</hi> was wont to offer up his sacrifice. But others tell the tale thus.
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:199139:168"/> When as the great Gyants called the <hi>Tytans,</hi> laboured as much as might be to pull <hi>Jupiter</hi> out of Heaven, the Gods thought it good to lay their heads toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to advise what was best to be done: Their conclusion was, that they should all with one consent join hands together to keep out such fellows: and that this their league might be confirmed, and throughly ratified; they caused the <hi>Cyclops,</hi> (which were workmen of <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>) to make them an Altar: about this Altar all the Gods assembled, and there sware, that with one consent they would withstand their enemies; afterwards, having gotten the victory, it pleased them to place this Altar in heaven, as a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of their League, and a token of that good which unity doth breed.</p>
               <p n="14">14. CORONA AUSTRINA, the <hi>South Garland,</hi> it hath 13. stars. Some say that it is some trifling <hi>Garland</hi> which <hi>Sagittarius</hi> was wont to wear, but he cast it away from him in jest, and therefore it was placed between his legs: others call it the Wheel of <hi>Ixion,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was tormented for that great courtesy he would have offered unto
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:199139:169"/>
                  <hi>Juno,</hi> thinking indeed to have gotten up her belly: but <hi>Jupiter</hi> seeing the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the man, tumbled him out of Heaven (where by the licence of the Gods he was somtime admitted as a guest) into Hell, there to be continually tormented upon a wheel. The Figure of which wheel was afterwards placed in Heaven, to teach men to take heed how they be so saucie, to make such courteous profers unto other mens wives. The Greekes call this Constellation by the name of <hi>Uraniscus,</hi> because of the Figure thereof: For it representeth the palate▪ or roof of the mouth, which they call <hi>Uraniscus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15. The last is PISCIS AUSTRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NUS, or <hi>Notius,</hi> the <hi>South Fish,</hi> which comprehendeth 11. stars, besides that which is in the mouth thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the water, which runneth from <hi>Aquarius,</hi> and is called by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians <hi>Fomahant.</hi> The reason why this <hi>Fish</hi> was placed in the Heaven, is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: yet some affirm, that the daughter of <hi>Venus</hi> going into a water to wash her self, was suddenly transformed into a fish; the which fish was afterward
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:199139:169"/> translated into Heaven. The unformed stars belonging unto this Constellation are six.</p>

Novidius</hi> will
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:199139:170"/> have this to be the <hi>Ram</hi> which <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> offered up in stead of his son <hi>Isaac.</hi> The star that is first in the head of the <hi>Ram,</hi> is that from whence our later Astronomers do account the Longitude of all the rest, and it is distant from the head of <hi>Aries,</hi> in the tenth Sphere, 27 deg. 53. min. The unformed stars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing unto this Constellation, are five.</p>
               <p n="2">2. TAURUS, the <hi>Bull,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth of 23. stars. This was translated into Heaven in memorial of the rape committed by <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Europa,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Agenor,</hi> King of Sidon; whom <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the likeness of a white <hi>Bull</hi> stole away, and transported into <hi>Candie.</hi> Others say, that it was <hi>Io</hi> the daughter of <hi>Inachus,</hi> whom <hi>Jupiter</hi> loved, and turned into the form of a Cow, to the intent that <hi>Iuno</hi> comming upon him at unawares, should not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what a part he had playd: <hi>Iupiter</hi> afterward in memorial of that craftie conveyance, placed that Figure in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; The reason why the Poets name not certainely whether it be a Cow or a Bull, is, because it wanteth the hinder parts; yet of the most of them it is
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:199139:170"/> called a <hi>Bull.</hi> In the Neck of the <hi>Bull</hi> there are certain stars standing together in a cluster, which are commonly called the <hi>seven Stars;</hi> although there can hardly be discerned any more then six. These are reported to be the seven daughters of <hi>Atlas,</hi> called <hi>Atlantiades,</hi> whereof six had company with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Gods, but the seventh (whose name was <hi>Morope</hi>) being married unto <hi>Sysiphus</hi> a mortal man, did therefore withdraw and hide her self, as being ashamed that she was not so fortunate in matching her self as her sisters were. Some say, that that star which is wanting is <hi>Electra,</hi> the eldest daughter of <hi>Atlas,</hi> and that therefore it is so dim, because she could not abide to behold the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of <hi>Troy;</hi> but at that time, and ever since, she hid her face. The reason why they were taken up into Heaven, was, their great pittie towards their father, whose mishap they bewayled with continual tears. Others say, that whereas they had vowed perpetual vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginity, and were in danger to lose it, by reason of <hi>Orion,</hi> who greatly assayled them, being overtaken with their love;
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:199139:171"/> they requested <hi>Jupiter</hi> to stand their friend; who translated them into stars, and placed them in that part of Heaven. The Poets call them <hi>Pleiades,</hi> because when they rise with the Sun, the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners may commit themselves to the Sea. Others will have them to be termed so <hi>a pluendo;</hi> because they procure rain. Others give them this name, of the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, because they be many in number. They be also called <hi>Vergiliae,</hi> because they rise with the Sun in the <hi>Spring</hi> time: likewise <hi>Athoraiae,</hi> because they stand so thick together. Our men call them by the name of the <hi>seven Stars,</hi> or Brood Hen. The Astronomers note this as a special thing concerning these stars, that when the Moon and these stars do meet together, the eyes are not to be medled withall, or cured if they be sore: their reason is, because they be of the nature of <hi>Mars,</hi> and the <hi>Moon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, there be five stars in the face of the <hi>Bull,</hi> representing the form of the <hi>Roman</hi> letter V, whereof one (which is the greatest) is called the <hi>Bul's Ey.</hi> They be called <hi>Hyades,</hi> and
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:199139:171"/> were also the daughters of <hi>Atlas,</hi> who so long bewayled the death of <hi>Hyas</hi> their brother, slain by a <hi>Lyon,</hi> that they died for sorrow, and were afterward placed in Heaven for a memorial of that great love they bare to their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The ancient <hi>Romans</hi> call the <hi>Bul's Ey, Parilicium,</hi> or <hi>Palelicium;</hi> of <hi>Pales</hi> their goddesse; whose feast they celebrated, after the conjunction of this star and the Sun. The unformed stars belonging unto this Constellation, are eleven.</p>
               <p n="3">3. GEMINI, the <hi>Twins;</hi> it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth of 18. stars. The Poets say they are <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> the sons of <hi>Leda,</hi> brethren most loving, whom therefore <hi>Jupiter</hi> translated into Heaven. Some say that the one of them is <hi>Apollo,</hi> and the other <hi>Hercules:</hi> but the most affirm the former. The unformed stars of this Constellation are seven, whereof one is called <hi>Propus,</hi> because it is placed next before the foot of <hi>Castor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. CANCER, the <hi>Crab,</hi> it hath 9. stars. This is that <hi>Crab</hi> which bit <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules</hi> by the heel as he fought with the Serpent <hi>Hydra</hi> in the Fen <hi>Lerna;</hi> and
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:199139:172"/> for his forward service, was placed in Heaven by <hi>Juno,</hi> the utter enemy of <hi>Hercules.</hi> In this Constellation, there are stars much spoken of by the Poets; although they be but small; whereof one is called the <hi>Crib,</hi> other two are the two Asses, whereof one was the Asse of <hi>Bacchus</hi> the other of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they rode to battel, when as the Gyants made warr with the Gods, with whose braying and strange noise, the Gyants were so scared upon the sudden, that they forsook the field, and fled. The Gods getting the victory, in tryumphing manner, translated both the Asses, and their manger into Heaven. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed stars of this Constellation are four.

<pb n="337" facs="tcp:199139:172"/> other he was most friendly unto <hi>Daniel.</hi> In the breast of this Constellation is that notable great star, the light whereof is such, as that therefore it is called by Astronomers, <gap reason="foreign">

The unformed stars belonging to the <hi>Lyon</hi> are eight; whereof three make the Constellation which is now called <hi>Coma Berenices,</hi> that is, the hair of Berenice This Constellation was first found out and invented, by <hi>Canon</hi> the Mathematician, but described by <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus</hi> the Poet. The occasion of the Story was this, <hi>Ptolomeus Evergetes</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving married his sister <hi>Berenice,</hi> was shortly after, enforced to depart from her, by reason of the warres he had begun in <hi>Asia:</hi> whereupon <hi>Berenice</hi> made this vow, that if he returned home again in safety, she would offer up her hair in <hi>Venus</hi> Temple. <hi>Ptolome</hi> returned safe, and <hi>Berenice,</hi> according to her vow, cut off her hair and hung it up. After certain days, the hair was not to be found; whereupon <hi>Ptolome</hi> the King was greatly displeased: but <hi>Canon,</hi> to please the humor of the King, and to
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:199139:173"/> curry favour with him, perswaded him that <hi>Venus</hi> had conveyed the hair into Heaven. <hi>Canon</hi> attributeth seven stars unto it, but <hi>Ptolome</hi> allotteth it but three because the other be insensible.</p>
               <p n="6">6. VIRGO, the <hi>Virgin,</hi> it hath 26. stars. This is affirmed to be Justice, which among all the Gods somtime living upon the earth, did last of all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the same, because of the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that began to multiply therein, and chose this place for her seat in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>Others say, that it was <hi>Astraea,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Astraeus,</hi> one of the Gyants that were called <hi>Titans,</hi> who fighting against the Gods, <hi>Astraea</hi> took their parts against her own father, and was therefore after her death commended unto the Heavens, and made one of the 12. Signes.</p>
               <p>Others say, that it was <hi>Erigone,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Icarius,</hi> who for that her father was slain by certain drunken men, for very griefe thereof did hang herself: but <hi>Jupiter</hi> taking pitty of the <hi>Virgin</hi> for her natural affection, translated her into Heaven.</p>
               <pb n="341" facs="tcp:199139:173"/>
               <p>In her right wing there is one star of special note, which by the Astronomers is called <hi>Vindemeator (i. e.)</hi> the gatherer of grapes. This was <hi>Ampelos</hi> the son of a <hi>Satyr</hi> and a <hi>Nymph,</hi> and greatly beloved of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> unto whom in token of his love, <hi>Bacchus</hi> gave a singular fair Vine, planted at the foot of an <hi>Elme</hi> (as the manner was in old time.) But <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelos</hi> in harvest gathering grapes, and taking little heed to his footing, fell down out of the Vine, and brake his neck. <hi>Bacchus</hi> in memorial of his former affection, translated him into Heaven, and made him one of the principal stars in this Constellation. There is another great star in the hand of the <hi>Virgin,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of the Latines <hi>Spica,</hi> of the Greeks <hi>Stachus,</hi> of the Arabians <hi>Azimech (i. e.)</hi> the <hi>ear of Corne:</hi> whereby they signify, that when the Sun cometh to this Signe, the corn waxeth ripe. <hi>Albumazar</hi> the Arabian, and <hi>Novidius,</hi> take this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation for the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed stars in this Constellation, are six.</p>
               <p n="7">7. LIBRA, the <hi>Ballance,</hi> it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth 8. stars. <hi>Cicero</hi> calleth it <hi>Jugum</hi>
                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:199139:174"/> the <hi>Yoke,</hi> and here it is to be noted, that the ancient Astronomers that first set down the number of the Constellations contained in the Zodiack, did account but eleven therein, so that the Signe which now is called <hi>Libra,</hi> was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore called <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that is to say, the <hi>clawes of the Scorpion,</hi> which possesseth the space of two whole Signes. But the latter Astronomers, being desirous to have 12. Signes in the Zodiack, called those eight whereof the <hi>Clawes of the Scorpion</hi> do consist, by the name of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bra;</hi> not that there was any Poetical Fiction to induce them thereto but only moved by this reason; because the Sun joyning with this Constellation, the day and the night are of an equal length, and are (as it were) equally poysed in a pair of Ballance. Yet (as I remember) some will have this to be the Ballance wherein Justice, called also <hi>Astraea,</hi> weighed the deeds of mortal men, and therein presented them unto <hi>Iupiter.</hi> It hath 9. unformed stars appertaining unto it.</p>
               <p n="8">8. SCORPIO, the <hi>Scorpion;</hi> called of the Arabians, <hi>Alatrab;</hi> of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,

The fiction is thus. <hi>Orion</hi> the son of <hi>Hyreus</hi> greatly beloved of <hi>Diana,</hi> was wont to make his boast, that he was able to overcome what beast soever was bred upon the earth: The Earth, being moved with this speech, brought forth the <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,</hi> whereby <hi>Orion</hi> was stung to death. <hi>Jupiter</hi> thereupon, (at the request of the Earth,) translated both the <hi>Scorpion,</hi> and <hi>Orion</hi> into Heaven; to make it a lesson for ever for mortal men, not to trust too much unto their own strength: and to the end he might signify the great enmity between them, he placed them so in the Heaven, that whensoever the one ariseth, the other setteth; and they are never both of them seen together above the Horizon at once. <hi>Gulielmus Postellus</hi> will have it to be the <hi>Serpent</hi> which beguiled <hi>Eve</hi> in Paradise. The unformed stars about this <hi>Scorpion</hi> are three.</p>
               <p n="9">9. SAGITTARIUS, the <hi>Archer.</hi> It hath thirty one stars. Touching this Signe, there are among the Poets many and sundry opinions. Some say that it is <hi>Crocus,</hi> the son of <hi>Eupheme,</hi> that
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:199139:175"/> was nurse unto the Muses. This <hi>Crocus</hi> was so forward in learning of the liberal sciences, and in the practise of fears of activity, that the Muses entreated <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> that he might have a place in Heaven. To whose request <hi>Jupiter</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining, made him one of the 12. Signes: And to the end that he might express the excellent qualities of the man, he made his hinder parts like unto a horse, thereby to signify his singular knowledge in horsemanship: and by his Bow and Arrow, he declared the sharpness of his wit. Whereupon the Astrologers have this conceit, that he that is born under <hi>Sagittarius,</hi> shall attain to the knowledge of many Artes, and be of prompt wit, and great courage. <hi>Virgil</hi> affirmeth this to be <hi>Chiron</hi> the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taur, who for his singular learning and Justice, was made the Master of <hi>Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les.</hi> At which time <hi>Hercules</hi> coming to visit him (for he had heard both of the worthiness of the Schoolmaster and of the great hopes of the Scholler) brought with him his quiver of arrows dipped in the blood of the Serpent <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra;</hi> but <hi>Chiron</hi> being desirous to see
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:199139:175"/> his shafts, and not taking heed of them, being in his hand, let one of them fall upon his foot, and being greatly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, not only by the anguish of the poyson working in the wound, but much more because he knew himself to be immortal, and his wound not to be recovered by medicine, he was enforced to make request unto the Gods, that he might be taken out of the world, who pittying his case, took him up into Heaven, and made him one of the 12. Signes.</p>
               <p n="10">10. CAPRICORNUS, the <hi>Goat,</hi> it consisteth of 28. stars. The Poets say, that this was <hi>Pan,</hi> the God of the shepherds, of whom they faign in this manner: The Gods having war with the Gyants, gathered themselves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into <hi>Aegypt, Typhon</hi> the Gyant pursued them thither, whereby the Gods were brought into a quandary, that well was he that by changing his shape might shift for himself. <hi>Jupiter</hi> turned himself into a <hi>Ram: Apollo</hi> became a <hi>Crow: Bacchus,</hi> a <hi>Goat: Diana</hi> lurked under the form of a <hi>Cat: Juno</hi> transformed her self into a <hi>Cow: Venus,</hi>
                  <pb n="346" facs="tcp:199139:176"/> into a <hi>Fish: Pan</hi> leaping into the river <hi>Nilus,</hi> turned the upper part of his body, into a <hi>Goat,</hi> and the lower part into a <hi>Fish. Jupiter</hi> wondring at his strange device, would needs have that Image and picture translated into Heaven, and made one of the 12. Signes. In that the hinder part of this Signe is like a Fish, it betokeneth, that the latter part of the moneth wherein the Sun possesseth this S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="11">11. AqUARIUS, the <hi>Waterman.</hi> It hath 42. stars, whereof some make the Figure of the Man: other some, the Water pot; and some, the stream of water that runneth out of the pot. This is feigned to be <hi>Ganimedes</hi> the <hi>Trojan,</hi> the son of <hi>Tros,</hi> and <hi>Callirhoe,</hi> whom <hi>Jupiter</hi> did greatly love for his excellent favour and beauty, and by the service of his Eagle carried him up into Heaven, where he made him his Cup-bearer, and called him <hi>Aquarius.</hi> Others not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, thinke it to be <hi>Deucalion,</hi> the son of <hi>Prometheus,</hi> whom the Gods translated into Heaven, in remembrance of that mighty deluge which hapned in his time, wherby mankind was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:199139:176"/> utterly taken away from the face of the earth. The unformed stars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing unto this Signe are three.</p>
               <p n="12">12. PISCES, the <hi>Fishes:</hi> these together with the line that knitteth them together, contain 34. stars. The Poets say that <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Cupid</hi> her son coming upon a certain time unto the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and sitting upon the bank thereof, upon a sudden espied <hi>Typhon</hi> the <hi>Gyant,</hi> that mighty and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful enemy of the Gods coming towards them. Upon whose sight▪ they being stricken with exceeding fear, leapt into the River, where they were received by two Fishes, and by them saved from drowning. <hi>Venus</hi> for this good turn, translated them into Heaven. <hi>Gulielmus Postellus</hi> would have them to be the two Fishes wherwith Christ fed the 5000. men. The unformed stars of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation, are four.</p>
               <p>Thus have I briefly run over the Poetical reasons of the Constellations: It remains now that I speak of the <hi>Milky way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VIA LACTEA, or <hi>Circulus Lacteus;</hi> by the Latines so called; and
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:199139:177"/> by the Greekes, <hi>Galaxia;</hi> and by the English, the <hi>Milky way.</hi> It is a broad white Circle that is seen in the Heaven, in the North Hemisphere, it beginneth at <hi>Cancer,</hi> on each side the head there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and passeth by <hi>Auriga,</hi> by <hi>Perseus,</hi> and <hi>Cassiopeia,</hi> the <hi>Swan,</hi> and the head of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> the tayl of <hi>Scorpio,</hi> and the feet of <hi>Centaur, Argo</hi> the <hi>Ship,</hi> and so unto the head of <hi>Cancer.</hi> Some in a sporting manner, do call it <hi>Watling street;</hi> but why they call it so, I cannot tell; except it be in regard of the narrowness that it seemeth to have, or else in respect of that great high way that lieth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Dover</hi> and S. <hi>Albons,</hi> which is called by our men, <hi>Watling street.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning this Circle there are sundry opinions: for there is great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference among some writers, both tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the place, matter and efficient cause thereof. <hi>Aristotle</hi> dissenteth from all other, both Philosophers and Poets, in the place, matter, and cause of this Circle; saying, that it is a Meteor ingendred in the Ayr, made of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors of the earth, drawn up thither by the heat of the Sun, and there set on
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:199139:177"/> fire, but his opinion is of all men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed.</p>
               <p>First, touching the place, it cannot be in the Ayr; for whatsoever is in the Ayr, is not seen of all men, at all times, to be under one and the same part of Heaven. If we see it in the South, they that are in the West shall see it under the East side of the Heaven; and they that are in the East, shall see it in the West part of the Heaven; but this Circle is of all men seen alwayes under the same part of Heaven, and to be joyned with the same stars; therefore it cannot be in the Ayr.</p>
               <p>Again, for the matter it cannot be made of that which <hi>Aristotle</hi> nameth, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the vapours of the earth, because of the long continuance of the thing, and that without any alteration: for it is impossible that any meteor made of vapours drawn up from the water, or exhalations from the earth, should last so long; as may be seen in blazing stars; which though they have continued long, as namely, 16. moneths, some more, some less; yet at the length they have vanished away: whereas this Circle hath
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:199139:178"/> continued from the beginning unto this day. Beside, put case it were made of these exhalations, whence will they infer the uniformity thereof? The Comets do alter diversly, both in the fashion of their blazing, and also in their several quantities; whereas in this Circle, there is nothing but the same part, alwayes of one form and of one bigness. In the efficient cause therefore he must needs err: for if it be neither in the Air, nor made of the exhalations of the earth, it cannot be caused by the Sun; for the one is the place, and the other the matter, wherein, and whereupon the Sun shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his power.</p>
               <p>All other, (besides <hi>Aristotle</hi>) agree in the place, but differ in the efficient cause thereof: and they are either Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers or Poets. Both these affirm that it is the Firmament <hi>(i. e▪)</hi> in the eight Sphere; but they disagree in the cause thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ovid</hi> saith, that it is the great Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey, and the high way that leadeth unto the Palace of <hi>Jupiter;</hi> but he alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not the cause of the whiteness; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like he would have us imagine that it is made of white Marble.</p>
               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:199139:178"/>
               <p>Others therefore alledge these causes: <hi>Jupiter</hi> having begotten <hi>Mercury</hi> of <hi>Maia</hi> the daughter of <hi>Atlas,</hi> brought the child when he was born, to the breast of <hi>Juno</hi> lying a sleep; But <hi>Juno</hi> awaking, threw the child out of her lap, and let the milke run out of her breast in such abundance that (spreading it self about the Heaven) it made that Circle which we see. Others say, that it was not <hi>Mercury,</hi> but <hi>Hercules;</hi> and that <hi>Juno</hi> did not let the milke run out of her breast; but that <hi>Hercules</hi> suckt them so earnestly, that his mouth run over, and so this Circle was made.</p>
               <p>Others say; that <hi>Saturn</hi> being desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to devour his children, his wife <hi>Ops</hi> presented him with a stone wrapped in a clout, insteed of his child. This stone stuck so fast in <hi>Saturn</hi> his throat, as he would have swallowed it, that without doubt he had therewithall been choaked, had he not been relieved by his wife, who by pressing the milke out of her brests, saved his life: the milke that missed his mouth (whereof you must suppose some sufficient quantity) fell on the Heavens and running along, made
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:199139:179"/> this Circle. And thus you hear the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Poets; who although in some circumstance they differ, yet do they Jump all in this; that it is in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament, howsoever the causes they alledge, are very frivolous.</p>
               <p>The Philosophers, (and chiefely <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus</hi>) affirm the cause of the thing, to be the exceeding great number of stars in that part of Heaven, whose beams meeting together so confusedly, and not coming distinctly to the ey, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth us to imagine such a whiteness as is seen. But the best opinion is this, that this <hi>Milky way</hi> is a part of the Firmament, neither so thin as the other parts thereof are, nor yet so thick as the stars them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. If it were as thin as the other parts of the Heaven besides the stars, then could it not retain the light, but the light would pass through it and not be seen: If it were as thick as the stars, then would the light be so doubled in it, that it would glister, and shine as the stars themselves do: but being neither so thin as the one, nor so thick as the other, it becommeth of that whiteness we see.</p>
               <pb n="353" facs="tcp:199139:179"/>
               <p>D<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. HOOD <hi>Commenting upon Constellations, saith;</hi> The stars are brought into Constellations, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions sake: things cannot be taught without names: to give a name to every star had been troublesome to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and for the Scholler; for the Master to devise, and for the Scholler to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member: and therefore the Astronomers have reduced many stars into one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation, that thereby they may tell the better where to seek them; and being sought, how to express them. Now the Astronomers did bring them into these Figures, and not into other, being moved thereto by these three reasons: first these Figures express some properties of the stars that are in them; as those of the <hi>Ram</hi> to be hot and dry; <hi>Andromeda</hi> chained, betokeneth imprisonment: the head of <hi>Medusa</hi> cut off, signifieth the loss of that part: <hi>Orion</hi> with his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible and threatning gesture importeth tempest, and terrible effects: The <hi>Serpent,</hi> the <hi>Scorpion,</hi> and the <hi>Dragon,</hi> signify poyson: The <hi>Bull,</hi> insinuateth a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy passion: The <hi>Bear</hi> inferreth cruelty, &amp;c. Secondly, the stars, (if not
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:199139:180"/> precisely yet after a sort) do represent such a Figure, and therefore that Figure was assigned them: as for example, the <hi>Crown,</hi> both North, and South; the <hi>Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,</hi> and the Triangle, represent the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure which they have. The third cause, was the continuance of the memory of some notable men, who either in regard of their singular pains taken in Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or in regard of some other notable deed, had well deserved of Man-kind.</p>
               <p>The first author of every particular Constellation is uncertain; yet are they of great antiquity; we receive them from <hi>Ptolome<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>▪</hi> and he followed the <hi>Platonicks;</hi> so that their antiquity is great. Moreover we may perceive them to be ancient by the Scriptures; and by the Poets. In the 38. Chapter of <hi>Job</hi> there is mention made of the <hi>Pleiades, Orion,</hi> and <hi>Arcturus,</hi> and <hi>Mazzar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th,</hi> which some interpret the 12. Signes: <hi>Job</hi> lived in the time of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as <hi>Sydero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> maketh mention in his Book <hi>de Commensurandis locorum distantiis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now besides all this, touching the reason of the invention of these Constel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, the Poets in setting forth those
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:199139:180"/> Stories, had this purpose, to make men fall in love with Astronomy. When <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mosthenes</hi> could not get the people of <hi>Athens</hi> to hear him in a matter of great moment, and profitable for the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, he began to tell them a tale of a fellow that sold an Ass; by the which tale he so brought on the Athenians, that they were both willing to hear his whole Oration▪ and to put in practice that whereto he exhorted them. The like intent had the Poets in these Stories: They saw that Astronomy being for commodity singular in the life of man, was almost of all men utterly neglected: Hereupon they began to set forth that art under these Fictions; that thereby, such as could not be perswaded by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, might by the pleasure be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to take a view of these matters: and thereby at length fall in love with them. For commonly you shall note this, that he that is ready to read the Stories, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not content himself therewith, but desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth also to know the Constellation, or at leastwise some principal star therein.</p>
